Who is God?? Is God real??,"Men make gods, not the other way around, this accounts for the large number of different gods in different ages and cultures.
If you can't explain something, invent a god who made it. Don't like the idea of dying? Invent an afterlife.
Inventing a deity solves SO many problems."
,"It depends on who you ask. To many people, God is a figment of the imagination with a book that is as meaningless as the Twilight series. To others, such as myself, God is the one true God that is alive to this very day. He created the universe and everything in it. God's book, the Bible, is the foundation for everything we believe. Best of luck my friend!"
,"I have no idea. I don't know for sure if there is a god or not. I don't believe in one. For all I know, there might have been a great celestial being who was dying out because he was the last of his kind and he decided to use that up by turning the rest of his life force into this universe. I don't know."
,"Who is God?? - What name do you give that which has created? God? If so, then man is God. Man created the many aspects regarding the concept of God/Gods. In early writings and etchings, it was the concept of God/Gods that man brought into this world to answer questions unanswerable at the time.
Is God real?? - What is Real? What is perceived to be based on our worldview of reality? If so, would Santa Claus be real to a 4 year old whom was indoctrinated to believe so? The idea of free presents given by an Omnipresent man made from his magical elves, is enough for any simple minded child to create many confirmation biases to keep the illusion alive. Is it any wonder why the scriptures call for believers to be ""Child like in their faith""?"
,"Just want to add this. My nephew before he turned 1 year old always referred to his mother by saying ma or maam!! Baby speech. Of course he can't talk yet. My question is, how did he know that's his mom ? No one ever told him and for sure no one ever called his mother that."
,"It depends on you, if you believe , then it 's real, it's on our mind, but I have an advice, in our life, it's better to have a believing, it can make us be confident to do somethings."
,"I believe in something or else they'd be nothing. Goodness and mind none of which can be seen or measured, love cannot be measured either.
 If I watch TV it tends to be along the lines of David Attenborough, humans living in diverse settings or history. What have I learned? That mankind is unnatural in its way, and destructive, we wasn't always so. That tribes live long lives without western medicine, for they have lived in harmony with the spirit of nature. It hasn't been western society teaching tribal culture how to cure but the other way round. Much of our sickness is due to living in close proximity and the state of our food source.  
As for religious texts many point to Sumer the first civilisation whether they have created many gods or used all those god traits in one. Why did we settle and create elaborate buildings and sewage systems? Domesticate cattle and wild grass, create a banking system? All that has ended us here. Wherever we are so is concrete, toxins and poverty. Why would nomad tribes who lived in harmony with the land for thousands of years, choose to settle when common sense told them that creating a surplus food supply makes it vulnerable to control? Whoever controls the food source controls everyone. People talk about religious ideas brainwashing man, many ideas brainwash man besides religion. If they didn't we certainly wouldn't be working at least 40 hours a week, or being fined for rules we did not make. Common law says you ""must not harm your neighbour."" Yet here we are bogged down with statutes and contract law of which none follow that common law, they are there to make our corporations money and everything is a corporation a legal entity.  Still they have enslaved and examined human interaction for years.
 Bill Gates is for vaccination to control the population. Their intent has always been create conflict through polarity, create the solution once society has had enough and has no where else to turn. Then society remains loyal to their masters. Put Christian up against Muslim, Atheist up against Theist and Republican up against Democrat. The result is the same totalitarianism masked as choice.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7XRUEuVP2qE
We shall unleash the nihilists and the atheists and we shall provoke a great social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to all nations the effect of absolute atheism; the origins of savagery and of most bloody turmoil.Then everywhere, the people will be forced to defend themselves against the world minority of the world revolutionaries and will exterminate those destroyers of civilization and the multitudes disillusioned with Christianity whose spirits will be from that moment without direction and leadership and anxious for an ideal, but without knowledge where to send its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer brought finally out into public view. A manifestation which will result from a general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and Atheism; both conquered and exterminated at the same time.

,God can be whatever or whomever. Hey we have santa clause the easter bunny. So who says their not real
,"Let me answer your questions in reverse.
Is God real?---my answer is ""yes"", I think so""---and I think that for numerous reasons.
Many will say ""no"" also for numerous reasons.
Either they are right or I am right---God's existence is not contingent upon what any human thinks or believes about His existence.
Who is God?    Well, any God worthy of the name would be at least as good as the best person I know, would be all powerful, and would have every good quality I could ever imagine. (Of course, you could think he is cruel and uncaring---but who would want such a God?)
If you want to find Him, you can; and He will reveal Himself to you.
Of course, many people with disagree with me, so maybe the best thing to do is to seek Him by yourself."
,"God or gods are real.  What they want, who knows?  Religions speculate a lot on the subject.  I believe in the Jewish/Christian/Islamic god.  That does not make me right, I just real it does.  The existence of a god is incontestable. 
St Thomas Aquinas in his 5 proofs of god described it well, either the universe has always existed, came from something else, or was created.  If you accept the first, fine.  If you accept the second, it just pushes the question backwards and is essentially a version of the first, so fine.  If you accept the third you are accepting the existence of a god.  The same arguments to be assigned to where god came from only all three point to a god so for that it is cyclic logic and therefore invalid.
The reason I consider Aquinas's arguments as valid is not where the world/universe came from but rather where did life come from.  I wrote a response discussing life elsewhere on blurt it (philosophy-religion.blurtit.com/4411070/why-do-people-believ).
The steady state theory of the universe, that is to say the theory the universe has always existed has been universally abandoned by all scientific theories. This means life could not have always existed.  Even if you accept the universe came from something else and can be pushed back infinity in time such that the matter/energy that makes up the universe has always existed, with the universe coming into existence especially as described by the Big Bang theory, life did not exist at that moment.  Therefore life came about within the universe.  As described in  my referenced article, life is not unlikely even given the trillions or more of astronomical bodies, it is not improbable, it is not near impossible, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE to occur naturally.  It required a deliberate act.
Please note that the article does not even begin to indicate the actual odds against life.  There are literally hundreds of major biochemical systems within even the simplest of living organisms.  The computations were for just one part of one system.  And as I said randomly it might be possible for any single DNA strand or RNA strand or polypeptide or any lipid or other component to be created by natural means but for all the components to be created all in the same place and at the same time in the exact ratios needed and to be enclosed and segregated such that the biochemical chain of reactions we call life could take place is impossible.
Oh and I have read the theories that life started as a short chain retro virus.  Possibly.  But a retro virus can not reproduce.  It does not have any metabolic pathways.  It depends solely upon the pathways of what ever LIVING cell it enters. That requires some other complete system.  Maybe the retro virus did come first, but it was not alive (depending on your definition of living, it is not alive as it cannot reproduce) until the living cell was subsequently appeared.  Under natural circumstances a single retro virus without any form of host will eventually be broken down.
There is a god or gods.  They may or may not care about us.  They may or may not even know we exist, life itself may be some unnoticed side affect of something they did eons ago.  If life on the earth is deliberate, we may actually be nothing more than a petri dish for making a vaccine or biological weapon.  As to whether any god desires worship, we cannot really know only think and/or believe.  As to whether any god has established rules for our lives, the same. 
I choose to believe that a least one god ""created"" us deliberately and that it cares what happens to us.  How you choose to view the gods is your choice, but I consider you are probably ignorant of biology and biochemistry if you consider life as occurring completely naturally."
,"God is For real for ever ! As we're alive !
He created us and created everything ! He saw everything ..!
If you read bible you can easily understand who he is
i describe him in just one word
""LOVE""!"
,"Depends on the answer to the following question.

""How old are you?""

If you are under a certain age, with religious parents who fearfully indoctrinate the only people gullible enough to accept the nonsense they peddle in a desperate attempt to ensure the next generation keeps making the same mistakes? I'm not going to tell you the truth. Go ahead and keep believing in a daddy god. Sweetie.

If you are over a certain, age, then you need to get over it. There is no god."
,"How do you really know that God is real? How do you know somebody
didn't just make Him up so we'd all feel better, and then passed that
information down to us? What if we made up God to feel less alone?""
These
are really good questions and we have answers for them. But questions
like these strike fear into the hearts of most parents, so we react with
the holy sounding dodge: ""Um, well, we just have to believe. The Bible
says blessed are those who have not seen and yet still believe."""
,"Have u ever felt something so strongly...no one could talk u out of it? That u just know?
That is how I feel and how I know God is real.
It happened while I was reading the Bible, maybe a few months ago, I just felt something inside me. Its hard to explain what it was but from that day on...I just knew."
,"Have no idea, never met him but heard of him. Quite a evasive character."
,yes he is.

man your god is your parents ??"
How do I get my question answered on Blurtit?,"If you ask a question, you will most likely get an answer if someone has the knowledge required to answer it.
However, there are some simple things askers can do to make it more likely they will get an answer:
Have a human avatar (it helps answerers feel like they're addressing someone, or helping someone out)
Ask the question in a clear and concise way. Some questions put people off when they are rambling and incoherent.
Don't be too specific. If you ask something like 'what is the puk code to my Samsung galaxy note with the the phone number 04882044005' - very few people will feel like they can help out.

Whereas, the answer to 'How do I find the PUK code on a Samsung?' might resonate with more people and be just as useful.
Ask something interesting.

Yes, we're here to try and help people out regardless of what the question is - but it's nice to answer interesting questions, so these will always get more attention."

,"It depends on who you ask. To many people, God is a figment of the imagination with a book that is as meaningless as the Twilight series. To others, such as myself, God is the one true God that is alive to this very day. He created the universe and everything in it. God's book, the Bible, is the foundation for everything we believe. Best of luck my friend!"
,"I have no idea. I don't know for sure if there is a god or not. I don't believe in one. For all I know, there might have been a great celestial being who was dying out because he was the last of his kind and he decided to use that up by turning the rest of his life force into this universe. I don't know."
,"Who is God?? - What name do you give that which has created? God? If so, then man is God. Man created the many aspects regarding the concept of God/Gods. In early writings and etchings, it was the concept of God/Gods that man brought into this world to answer questions unanswerable at the time.
Is God real?? - What is Real? What is perceived to be based on our worldview of reality? If so, would Santa Claus be real to a 4 year old whom was indoctrinated to believe so? The idea of free presents given by an Omnipresent man made from his magical elves, is enough for any simple minded child to create many confirmation biases to keep the illusion alive. Is it any wonder why the scriptures call for believers to be ""Child like in their faith""?"
,"Just want to add this. My nephew before he turned 1 year old always referred to his mother by saying ma or maam!! Baby speech. Of course he can't talk yet. My question is, how did he know that's his mom ? No one ever told him and for sure no one ever called his mother that."
,"It depends on you, if you believe , then it 's real, it's on our mind, but I have an advice, in our life, it's better to have a believing, it can make us be confident to do somethings."

 If I watch TV it tends to be along the lines of David Attenborough, humans living in diverse settings or history. What have I learned? That mankind is unnatural in its way, and destructive, we wasn't always so. That tribes live long lives without western medicine, for they have lived in harmony with the spirit of nature. It hasn't been western society teaching tribal culture how to cure but the other way round. Much of our sickness is due to living in close proximity and the state of our food source.  
As for religious texts many point to Sumer the first civilisation whether they have created many gods or used all those god traits in one. Why did we settle and create elaborate buildings and sewage systems? Domesticate cattle and wild grass, create a banking system? All that has ended us here. Wherever we are so is concrete, toxins and poverty. Why would nomad tribes who lived in harmony with the land for thousands of years, choose to settle when common sense told them that creating a surplus food supply makes it vulnerable to control? Whoever controls the food source controls everyone. People talk about religious ideas brainwashing man, many ideas brainwash man besides religion. If they didn't we certainly wouldn't be working at least 40 hours a week, or being fined for rules we did not make. Common law says you ""must not harm your neighbour."" Yet here we are bogged down with statutes and contract law of which none follow that common law, they are there to make our corporations money and everything is a corporation a legal entity.  Still they have enslaved and examined human interaction for years.
 Bill Gates is for vaccination to control the population. Their intent has always been create conflict through polarity, create the solution once society has had enough and has no where else to turn. Then society remains loyal to their masters. Put Christian up against Muslim, Atheist up against Theist and Republican up against Democrat. The result is the same totalitarianism masked as choice.

We shall unleash the nihilists and the atheists and we shall provoke a great social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to all nations the effect of absolute atheism; the origins of savagery and of most bloody turmoil.Then everywhere, the people will be forced to defend themselves against the world minority of the world revolutionaries and will exterminate those destroyers of civilization and the multitudes disillusioned with Christianity whose spirits will be from that moment without direction and leadership and anxious for an ideal, but without knowledge where to send its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer brought finally out into public view. A manifestation which will result from a general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and Atheism; both conquered and exterminated at the same time.

,God can be whatever or whomever. Hey we have santa clause the easter bunny. So who says their not real
,"Let me answer your questions in reverse.
Is God real?---my answer is ""yes"", I think so""---and I think that for numerous reasons.
Many will say ""no"" also for numerous reasons.
Either they are right or I am right---God's existence is not contingent upon what any human thinks or believes about His existence.
Who is God?    Well, any God worthy of the name would be at least as good as the best person I know, would be all powerful, and would have every good quality I could ever imagine. (Of course, you could think he is cruel and uncaring---but who would want such a God?)
If you want to find Him, you can; and He will reveal Himself to you.
Of course, many people with disagree with me, so maybe the best thing to do is to seek Him by yourself."
,"God or gods are real.  What they want, who knows?  Religions speculate a lot on the subject.  I believe in the Jewish/Christian/Islamic god.  That does not make me right, I just real it does.  The existence of a god is incontestable. 
St Thomas Aquinas in his 5 proofs of god described it well, either the universe has always existed, came from something else, or was created.  If you accept the first, fine.  If you accept the second, it just pushes the question backwards and is essentially a version of the first, so fine.  If you accept the third you are accepting the existence of a god.  The same arguments to be assigned to where god came from only all three point to a god so for that it is cyclic logic and therefore invalid.
The reason I consider Aquinas's arguments as valid is not where the world/universe came from but rather where did life come from.  I wrote a response discussing life elsewhere on blurt it (philosophy-religion.blurtit.com/4411070/why-do-people-believ).
The steady state theory of the universe, that is to say the theory the universe has always existed has been universally abandoned by all scientific theories. This means life could not have always existed.  Even if you accept the universe came from something else and can be pushed back infinity in time such that the matter/energy that makes up the universe has always existed, with the universe coming into existence especially as described by the Big Bang theory, life did not exist at that moment.  Therefore life came about within the universe.  As described in  my referenced article, life is not unlikely even given the trillions or more of astronomical bodies, it is not improbable, it is not near impossible, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE to occur naturally.  It required a deliberate act.
Please note that the article does not even begin to indicate the actual odds against life.  There are literally hundreds of major biochemical systems within even the simplest of living organisms.  The computations were for just one part of one system.  And as I said randomly it might be possible for any single DNA strand or RNA strand or polypeptide or any lipid or other component to be created by natural means but for all the components to be created all in the same place and at the same time in the exact ratios needed and to be enclosed and segregated such that the biochemical chain of reactions we call life could take place is impossible.
Oh and I have read the theories that life started as a short chain retro virus.  Possibly.  But a retro virus can not reproduce.  It does not have any metabolic pathways.  It depends solely upon the pathways of what ever LIVING cell it enters. That requires some other complete system.  Maybe the retro virus did come first, but it was not alive (depending on your definition of living, it is not alive as it cannot reproduce) until the living cell was subsequently appeared.  Under natural circumstances a single retro virus without any form of host will eventually be broken down.
There is a god or gods.  They may or may not care about us.  They may or may not even know we exist, life itself may be some unnoticed side affect of something they did eons ago.  If life on the earth is deliberate, we may actually be nothing more than a petri dish for making a vaccine or biological weapon.  As to whether any god desires worship, we cannot really know only think and/or believe.  As to whether any god has established rules for our lives, the same. 
I choose to believe that a least one god ""created"" us deliberately and that it cares what happens to us.  How you choose to view the gods is your choice, but I consider you are probably ignorant of biology and biochemistry if you consider life as occurring completely naturally."

,"Depends on the answer to the following question.

""How old are you?""

If you are under a certain age, with religious parents who fearfully indoctrinate the only people gullible enough to accept the nonsense they peddle in a desperate attempt to ensure the next generation keeps making the same mistakes? I'm not going to tell you the truth. Go ahead and keep believing in a daddy god. Sweetie.

If you are over a certain, age, then you need to get over it. There is no god."
,"How do you really know that God is real? How do you know somebody

,"Have u ever felt something so strongly...no one could talk u out of it? That u just know?

Do you think it's weird that I'm recording my school for this reason?,"I'm not a foreign exchange student, but most of my family lives in a different country. I travel there yearly, and want to show them what a typical American high school looks like. Is it weird for me to record my high school, during break/lunch time, with my phone to show them? Phones are allowed at that time.
Of course, there are movies, but I attend a high school, so why not show them mine. And I suck at describing. A video would be better. Is that weird?"
Do you think people are born atheist or theist?,"People are born with absolutely no knowledge of religion. Religion is taught, therefore, people are born non-believers."
,"The definition of ""theist"" is one who believes in the existence of god or gods.  The definition of ""a-thiest"" is one who does NOT (the ""a"" prefix) believe in god or gods. It is that simple.  
There are flavors of atheists beyond that, but lack of belief is at the core of them all.  Therefore, since a baby only ""knows"" what it is taught, it is, by default, an atheist -- a blank slate."
,"People tend to adapt to the faith of their parents, based on the region they live in. If you are born in the US, you are more likely than not, a Christian; In Iraq, a Muslim; in India, a Hindu. Religious faith is learned, NOT inborn. Believers are taught belief by other believers."
,"I think newborns are completely devoid of any sense of self or any other entity other than their immediate personal needs. They run on instinct .. To suckle and feed, because that is a survival instinct ... Beyond basic instinct is learned skills, and knowledge."
,"If people were born theists ... Or believing in a god ... Then EVERYBODY would be born with the same belief.  The belief in the true god(s).  Obviously, that is not the case, or there would not be hundreds of religions.  (sects, yes - but not completely differing religions)"
,"It would be an interesting experiment. Raise a child to 25 or so without any religious paraphernalia at all. No indoctrination.
I totally doubt she'd have faith of any supernatural kind.
Kind of impossible though. Believers in the supernatural salivate at the sight of young children. Not in any Subway sense, just at the thought that with the right method of persuasion, the child would enter their ranks and keep their faction one person further from obsolescence."
,"Since the base meaning of the word ""Atheism"" is ""Without God - No God"", we are born Atheist lack both the knowledge of the concept regarding God/Gods and along with any other knowledge other then our base instincts (the need to eat to stay alive).
Since this is not a conscious decision to choose NOT to believe in the concepts of religion, it is implicit. It is usually by cultural traditions that we indoctrinate our children. Hence, why some believe in one type of God, while others, another or none."
,"Do recall reading, some years ago, that someone has posited that people were born with a genetic disposition for or against  belief. They called it the ""God gene"".  Don't recall much beyond that, but do recall that there was quite a huhu about it at the time. "
,Religion is environmental. It depends on what family they are born into. I do have to say that it is human nature to want to believe in an external force for hope
,"Contrary to what a lot of the people here think we are not born blank slates and we are born with the mechanisms to at least be shunted toward the religious state, though not anything so specific as a god.
Take our pattern recognition ability and out attribution of agency ability. We see patterns and we attribute these patterns to agency, thus some forms of primitive religion is born.
Now babies would have no concept of gods though they have abilities such as folk physics, folk biology and the like. Gods are a very specific entity needing much in the way of human complication for their existence
So babies would be born atheist, having no belief in gods. . "
,"People are born with a clean slate, it's their parents and associates that place beliefs in their heads. My children had no influence to or away from religion from my wife or myself. They were allowed to go to church with their friends, and received answers to their religious questions in a nonpartisan way. All but one out of five is atheist."
,"Neither. They are born believers because they are magical thinkers. Children engage in imaginative play.  They ask a lot of questions, what happens when you die? What is death? Children engage in play in order to learn acceptance or make up their own minds. No person is completely logical we all dream and we all buy into superstitions. Would you buy and wear a dead mans coat? What if he'd been a murderer? No, because somehow you think his essence is attached, hence why we hold on to loved ones items. "
,No we all have to be taught that there is no Creator. As we grow and look at the awesom universe and all we have on earth to sustain life  the question come up who made all this? Genesis 1:1
,No one's atheist or theist when they're born. You are what your social environment creates you. The surrounding leads you to be theist/atheist.
,Everyone is born with a different religion.
,"Warning old question.
Superstition is hardwired into our brains."
,"Supersition pulls you in the direction
of your beliefs.
Let yourself be guided according
to your own nature."
,The children do not choose their religion. Their parents choose the religion for them.
,"Well, there was a fluff-up about a genetic ""god gene tenor twelve years ago or so (maybe longer - time flies when you are an oldz), which posited that some of us were born with a genetic predisposition to believe in the supernatural.  I don't know, but it does seem to me that some of us need to believe, and some of us just can't see the logic in that.  What scares me about the believers is that deep in a large chunk of humanity is a need to dictate behavior to the rest of us.  Combine those two and things can be ugly.  My personal feeling is that you can believe whatever silly stuff you want as long as you don't expect me to conform to your dogma, or acknowledge that your belief system is superior to mine. "
,"When we are born our minds are undeveloped and without knowledge. As we grow, we learn.
The children of religious parents are taught there is a God. They trust their parents and, for a time, believe.
Some set it aside and move on to other things; others hold their parents' belief all their lives.
But at the point of birth? Their minds are a clean slate. Well, more of a palimpsest, I suppose."
,every one is born a atheist. It is when people introduce religion to some one they are no longer a atheist oof
,"Being an atheist is a choice,God say's whoever seeks me will find me when they seek me with all of their heart."
,As we are created by a SPIRIT we are all born spiritual. 
,"No. I completely agree with Cookie Hill. Children naturally are born inquisitive about how we got here and who created the wonderful earth on which we live as well as this amazing awe inspiring universe and it's various cycles. We find the answer at Genesis 1:1 and Isaiah 45:18. When I meet and speak with atheists, one of the questions I always ask is ""Have you always been an atheist?"" Thus far, the answer that I've always received is no. We have all the reasons to believe that there is a Creator than not to believe that there is one. Interestingly, even when one chooses not to believe in a Creator, they still feel inclined to attribute it to something. I think it speaks to our innate desire to acknowledge that this amazing earth on which we live didn't just happen. For every cause there is an effect."
Why do some people think you'll go to hell just for being gay? Like can't you have an opinion over who you want to love??,"You ask:  Like can't you have an opinion over who you want to love??
So, you imply being gay is a choice you can make---do you believe that?"
,"people misinterpret the bible, thinking that being gay is a sin. Also, people (christians) throw their beliefs on others and it sucks. I personally have experienced hate while i was at a private christian school because i was gay. The only thing making people believe that your sexual orientation is a sin is beliefs and ignorance."
,Some would say that being gay is a demon that can be cast out.
,"Because they pick and choose what Bible verses to believe .. And the Old Testament in Leviticus says that homosexuality is a sin deserving death. 
Of course, it also says not to eat certain things or wear clothing made of multiple materials ... Which they conveniently ignore."
,B cuz the Bible says in 1st Chorinthians 6:9 that homosexuals will not enter the kingdom of God
,Your sexual orientation has nothing to do with hell or heaven because both don't exist. You live right and do whatever makes you happy without hurting other. Hell or heaven created by you with the kind of living you do.
,"If you are referring to one of the three monothestic religions the reason it was frowned on was because homosexuality was often seen in temple prostitution to other gods such as Ishtar. It is the homosexual act that is ""taboo""often translated as an abomination in the bible.
It is also noted that when man and woman join in love they become one flesh.
In Genesis 2:22 Woman was made from man's rib/side. In Jewish Midrash Adam or Adama was both male and female androgenous.
The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken from the man, and brought her to the man. The man said, ""This is now bone of my bones, And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man."" For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.

http://thetorah.com/the-making-of-adam/
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse_of_Adam
Genesis 2:24
Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: And they shall be one flesh.
Mark 10:8
And they twain shall be one flesh: So then they are no more twain, but one flesh.
Cor 6:16
Or do you not know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body with her? For He says, ""THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH.""
Eph 5:28 - 29
So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself; for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church,
Even in tantric sex the union must be between man and woman which is eastern belief."
,"Opinions seem to communicate Choice. Can you choose who you fall in love with? When did I choose to be heterosexual . . .
That being said, Most holy Scriptures have a problem with Same sex relationships. It was either misunderstood be the original writers, or Simply meant that the union would not produce fresh off-spring to Indoctrinate and keep the religion moving forward.
No Gods are required for men to produce texts to control the masses by fear of an invisible eternal punishment.
Lucky for them I guess . . . Becaue no Gods could be found."
,"Q ""Why do some people think you'll go to hell just for being gay? Like can't you have an opinion over who you want to love??""
Let's start with what you have boiled it down to: ""can't you have an opinion over who you want to love??""
If, say, it's just a handful of you on an Island by yourselves where no rules apply [extremely impractical, of course] then perhaps you cannot only have an opinion over who you want to love, be it your neighbour's wife, daughter or son, [or even all three] or what you want to smoke or snort but you can go ahead and act on that opinion.
However, if you want to organise yourselves into a smoothly functioning society then you will need rules or laws for the wellbeing and future of your society. Even in the most liberal of societies you will have limits beyond which you cannot put your opinions into practice. In the more conservative ones you might be taken to task for just expressing certain opinions, let alone acting upon them.
If a society enacts a certain law it will stipulate what it considers appropriate punishment for any breach of the law. Where a law accepted by a society comes from, or is claimed to come from, an external source [federal, international or ""God""] then that source will most likely have stipulated what it considers appropriate punishment for any breach of the law [be it imprisonment, lashes, stoning or a spell in hell, or any combination thereof]."
,"I'm a Catholic, but I have to say that I don't believe in a lot of things that the Church teaches.
First, I believe that an individual's relationship with God is between that person and God, and nobody else.  This is why I do not believe in confession.  First of all, God will know what sins I have committed, and he will know if I am repentant.  What reason is there to go and confess your transgressions to another human being?
As far as going to Hell when you die, I believe that only people who are evil and have committed evil deeds while they were alive wind up going to Hell.
Even if you never went to a mass in your entire life, but you are a good person with a kind heart, then you are going to go to Heaven.
Being gay certainly does NOT make you evil.  You are allowed to love who you want to love.  If that happens to be another man or another woman, or both, so be it.
I firmly believe that what determines where you go in the afterlife depends fully on how you treated other living things when you were on Earth. 
If you were malicious and you constantly hurt others and aimed to destroy the happiness of others, then you will reap what you sow."

up the data from the card on your computer and try reformatting it on

You could try a factory reset. Make sure you have all your data backed up. Go to Settings > Backup and reset > Factory data reset > Reset device > Erase everything.

Who is God?? Is God real??,"Men make gods, not the other way around, this accounts for the large number of different gods in different ages and cultures.
If you can't explain something, invent a god who made it. Don't like the idea of dying? Invent an afterlife.
Inventing a deity solves SO many problems."
,"It depends on who you ask. To many people, God is a figment of the imagination with a book that is as meaningless as the Twilight series. To others, such as myself, God is the one true God that is alive to this very day. He created the universe and everything in it. God's book, the Bible, is the foundation for everything we believe. Best of luck my friend!"
,"I have no idea. I don't know for sure if there is a god or not. I don't believe in one. For all I know, there might have been a great celestial being who was dying out because he was the last of his kind and he decided to use that up by turning the rest of his life force into this universe. I don't know."
,"Who is God?? - What name do you give that which has created? God? If so, then man is God. Man created the many aspects regarding the concept of God/Gods. In early writings and etchings, it was the concept of God/Gods that man brought into this world to answer questions unanswerable at the time.
Is God real?? - What is Real? What is perceived to be based on our worldview of reality? If so, would Santa Claus be real to a 4 year old whom was indoctrinated to believe so? The idea of free presents given by an Omnipresent man made from his magical elves, is enough for any simple minded child to create many confirmation biases to keep the illusion alive. Is it any wonder why the scriptures call for believers to be ""Child like in their faith""?"
,"Just want to add this. My nephew before he turned 1 year old always referred to his mother by saying ma or maam!! Baby speech. Of course he can't talk yet. My question is, how did he know that's his mom ? No one ever told him and for sure no one ever called his mother that."
,"It depends on you, if you believe , then it 's real, it's on our mind, but I have an advice, in our life, it's better to have a believing, it can make us be confident to do somethings."

 If I watch TV it tends to be along the lines of David Attenborough, humans living in diverse settings or history. What have I learned? That mankind is unnatural in its way, and destructive, we wasn't always so. That tribes live long lives without western medicine, for they have lived in harmony with the spirit of nature. It hasn't been western society teaching tribal culture how to cure but the other way round. Much of our sickness is due to living in close proximity and the state of our food source.  
As for religious texts many point to Sumer the first civilisation whether they have created many gods or used all those god traits in one. Why did we settle and create elaborate buildings and sewage systems? Domesticate cattle and wild grass, create a banking system? All that has ended us here. Wherever we are so is concrete, toxins and poverty. Why would nomad tribes who lived in harmony with the land for thousands of years, choose to settle when common sense told them that creating a surplus food supply makes it vulnerable to control? Whoever controls the food source controls everyone. People talk about religious ideas brainwashing man, many ideas brainwash man besides religion. If they didn't we certainly wouldn't be working at least 40 hours a week, or being fined for rules we did not make. Common law says you ""must not harm your neighbour."" Yet here we are bogged down with statutes and contract law of which none follow that common law, they are there to make our corporations money and everything is a corporation a legal entity.  Still they have enslaved and examined human interaction for years.
 Bill Gates is for vaccination to control the population. Their intent has always been create conflict through polarity, create the solution once society has had enough and has no where else to turn. Then society remains loyal to their masters. Put Christian up against Muslim, Atheist up against Theist and Republican up against Democrat. The result is the same totalitarianism masked as choice.

We shall unleash the nihilists and the atheists and we shall provoke a great social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to all nations the effect of absolute atheism; the origins of savagery and of most bloody turmoil.Then everywhere, the people will be forced to defend themselves against the world minority of the world revolutionaries and will exterminate those destroyers of civilization and the multitudes disillusioned with Christianity whose spirits will be from that moment without direction and leadership and anxious for an ideal, but without knowledge where to send its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer brought finally out into public view. A manifestation which will result from a general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and Atheism; both conquered and exterminated at the same time.
Albert Pike."
,God can be whatever or whomever. Hey we have santa clause the easter bunny. So who says their not real
,"Let me answer your questions in reverse.
Is God real?---my answer is ""yes"", I think so""---and I think that for numerous reasons.
Many will say ""no"" also for numerous reasons.
Either they are right or I am right---God's existence is not contingent upon what any human thinks or believes about His existence.
Who is God?    Well, any God worthy of the name would be at least as good as the best person I know, would be all powerful, and would have every good quality I could ever imagine. (Of course, you could think he is cruel and uncaring---but who would want such a God?)
If you want to find Him, you can; and He will reveal Himself to you.
Of course, many people with disagree with me, so maybe the best thing to do is to seek Him by yourself."
,"God or gods are real.  What they want, who knows?  Religions speculate a lot on the subject.  I believe in the Jewish/Christian/Islamic god.  That does not make me right, I just real it does.  The existence of a god is incontestable. 
St Thomas Aquinas in his 5 proofs of god described it well, either the universe has always existed, came from something else, or was created.  If you accept the first, fine.  If you accept the second, it just pushes the question backwards and is essentially a version of the first, so fine.  If you accept the third you are accepting the existence of a god.  The same arguments to be assigned to where god came from only all three point to a god so for that it is cyclic logic and therefore invalid.
The reason I consider Aquinas's arguments as valid is not where the world/universe came from but rather where did life come from.  I wrote a response discussing life elsewhere on blurt it (philosophy-religion.blurtit.com/4411070/why-do-people-believ).
The steady state theory of the universe, that is to say the theory the universe has always existed has been universally abandoned by all scientific theories. This means life could not have always existed.  Even if you accept the universe came from something else and can be pushed back infinity in time such that the matter/energy that makes up the universe has always existed, with the universe coming into existence especially as described by the Big Bang theory, life did not exist at that moment.  Therefore life came about within the universe.  As described in  my referenced article, life is not unlikely even given the trillions or more of astronomical bodies, it is not improbable, it is not near impossible, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE to occur naturally.  It required a deliberate act.
Please note that the article does not even begin to indicate the actual odds against life.  There are literally hundreds of major biochemical systems within even the simplest of living organisms.  The computations were for just one part of one system.  And as I said randomly it might be possible for any single DNA strand or RNA strand or polypeptide or any lipid or other component to be created by natural means but for all the components to be created all in the same place and at the same time in the exact ratios needed and to be enclosed and segregated such that the biochemical chain of reactions we call life could take place is impossible.
Oh and I have read the theories that life started as a short chain retro virus.  Possibly.  But a retro virus can not reproduce.  It does not have any metabolic pathways.  It depends solely upon the pathways of what ever LIVING cell it enters. That requires some other complete system.  Maybe the retro virus did come first, but it was not alive (depending on your definition of living, it is not alive as it cannot reproduce) until the living cell was subsequently appeared.  Under natural circumstances a single retro virus without any form of host will eventually be broken down.
There is a god or gods.  They may or may not care about us.  They may or may not even know we exist, life itself may be some unnoticed side affect of something they did eons ago.  If life on the earth is deliberate, we may actually be nothing more than a petri dish for making a vaccine or biological weapon.  As to whether any god desires worship, we cannot really know only think and/or believe.  As to whether any god has established rules for our lives, the same. 
I choose to believe that a least one god ""created"" us deliberately and that it cares what happens to us.  How you choose to view the gods is your choice, but I consider you are probably ignorant of biology and biochemistry if you consider life as occurring completely naturally."
,"God is For real for ever ! As we're alive !
He created us and created everything ! He saw everything ..!
If you read bible you can easily understand who he is
i describe him in just one word
""LOVE""!"
,"Depends on the answer to the following question.

""How old are you?""

If you are under a certain age, with religious parents who fearfully indoctrinate the only people gullible enough to accept the nonsense they peddle in a desperate attempt to ensure the next generation keeps making the same mistakes? I'm not going to tell you the truth. Go ahead and keep believing in a daddy god. Sweetie.

If you are over a certain, age, then you need to get over it. There is no god."
,"How do you really know that God is real? How do you know somebody
didn't just make Him up so we'd all feel better, and then passed that
information down to us? What if we made up God to feel less alone?""
These
are really good questions and we have answers for them. But questions
like these strike fear into the hearts of most parents, so we react with
the holy sounding dodge: ""Um, well, we just have to believe. The Bible
says blessed are those who have not seen and yet still believe."""
,"Have u ever felt something so strongly...no one could talk u out of it? That u just know?
That is how I feel and how I know God is real.
It happened while I was reading the Bible, maybe a few months ago, I just felt something inside me. Its hard to explain what it was but from that day on...I just knew."
,"Have no idea, never met him but heard of him. Quite a evasive character."
,yes he is.

How do I get my question answered on Blurtit?,"If you ask a question, you will most likely get an answer if someone has the knowledge required to answer it.
However, there are some simple things askers can do to make it more likely they will get an answer:
Have a human avatar (it helps answerers feel like they're addressing someone, or helping someone out)
Ask the question in a clear and concise way. Some questions put people off when they are rambling and incoherent.
Don't be too specific. If you ask something like 'what is the puk code to my Samsung galaxy note with the the phone number 04882044005' - very few people will feel like they can help out.

Whereas, the answer to 'How do I find the PUK code on a Samsung?' might resonate with more people and be just as useful.
Ask something interesting.

Yes, we're here to try and help people out regardless of what the question is - but it's nice to answer interesting questions, so these will always get more attention."

How Do I Prepare Myself For Interview?,"Preparation is key to a successful interview

Does the idea of going to a job interview make you feel a little queasy? Many people find that it is the hardest part of the hiring process. But it doesn't have to be. The more you prepare and practice, the more comfortable you will feel. Increase your odds of landing the job you want by brushing up on your interview skills.

Prepare before you go.
Find out all you can about the company before you go to the interview. Understand the products that they produce and/or the services that they provide. It's also good to know who the customers are and who the major competitors are.

Practice makes perfect.
It will also make you feel more confident and relaxed. So, practice your answers to common questions. Make a list of questions to ask, too. Almost all interviewers will ask if you have questions. This is a great opportunity for you to show that you have done your homework and have put some thought into your questions

Make a great impression.
The interview is your chance to show that you are the best person for the job. Your application or resume has already exhibited that you are qualified. Now it 's up to you to show how your skills and experience match this position and this company.

The employer will be looking and listening to determine if you are a good fit. He/she will be looking for a number of different qualities, in addition to the skills that you possess. To make the best impression, dress appropriately; sell your strengths; arrive early, by about 10-15 minutes; be enthusiastic; shake hands firmly; be an active listener; sit up straight and maintain eye contact; ask questions.

Say ""thank you"".
After the interview, follow up with a thank-you note. This is a chance for you to restate your interest and how you can benefit the company. Your best bet is to try to time it so that the note gets there before the hiring decision is made. You should also follow up with a phone call if you don't hear back from the employer within the specified time. Check out some samples:"
,"Interview is the most important part of your profession or we can say the first step towards your career. Interview is like a blind date, because you are excited and also nervous to meet a person whom you never met.

Remember that you have to prepare yourself mentally as well physically. The person who met you doesn't know about yourself and you have to convince him by your skills. By abilities you have to prove that you are the one for whom they look forward. You need to realize, however that the first impression are very critical. Many recruiters say that they make a decision just by looking at someone. Thus your goals should be look neat, appropriate and well groomed.

Now come towards the mental preparation because good looks are not enough to get a job. Presumably, you should do your home work for each organization you visit.
Well prepared about the organization, their products, their market value complete information about the organization. With all the preparation, behind you both mental and physically you are ready.

Don't move to that place so early, reach there before 10 to 15 minutes of the given time. Confidently enter to the room; never show any nervousness on your face. If they shake hand then you do, otherwise just sit down. Don't try to start conversation first, you are a guest and be an honorable guest."
,Prepare some questions and the most important thing is be confident all the time during interview.
,"Know something about the organisation or company you are applying to. (Check their website) Make sure you have a clean resume and a list of references.
Most of all relax and simply enjoy. Good luck to you."
,"The first thing you should do is find out about the company you are going to be applying to. Find out what they make, or what they do, find out what as much as you can so that you are knowledgeable in that regard. When interviewing use that information in a response so that the interviewer is aware that you have made an effort to educate yourself about the company,"" I am very interested in working for Jones Inc. I've always found ship building interesting. I have built model ships since I was ten years old."" In other words, pull your knowledge of the company into the conversation in some manner. You can do this via the net or by talking to someone that you may know that is connected with the company. I assume your resume is up to date, if it is not, fix that issue. Be prepared with your answers. You obviously can not know exactly what they are going to ask but generally they will ask a few of the same question...What is your long term employment goals? Why do you want to work for Jones Inc.? That is a good place to drop your knowledge of the company. How does your experience relate to the position you are applying for? What are your salary requirements? On a personal level, if you need a haircut, get one. Wear a button up the front shirt, tuck it in and wear a tie if you have one. Do not wear pants that are drooping low. If you have nice leather dress shoes, wear them. I know that is the style but the man/woman you are interviewing with is not a going to be a teen and most professional people do not dress like kids. If you are applying for a professional job, look professional. A suit, in this instance, would be nice. Do not wear any strong or overpowering after-shave or cologne. Remember your manners that Mama taught you...yes sir, no sir, thank you, shake hands etc. You probably know all of these things but I am a former personnel manager and you would be amazed at the people who do not, or possibly, they think they do not matter....they do."
,"The first thing you need to do is confirm about the date, venue, time of the interview and make a note about it.
Research, research and research!!!! Research about the company and it's products. Research about the skills and stuff related to the job profile. Research about yourself- Study your resume, have your dress for interview ready, etc.
Prepare for personal and technical round. Study everything related to your current field.
Make a list of questions you would like to ask the interviewer. Do not forget this."
,"The interview depends on the role you are applied for. If it’s technical role the interviewer will ask the questions from your subject and what you mentioned the skills in resume. Moreover the interviewer will check your communication skills and confidence levels.
Before attending the interview you can practice interview questions through some career guidance websites or practice mock interview in real-time. But, I prefer online mock interviews because practical knowledge is better than theoretical knowledge.
You can visit InterviewBuddy- (Online mock interviews with experts). It’s the best website to practice and prepare the interviews.
They will conduct the practice interviews on any stream with industry experts and provide detailed report with performance-based metrics comprehensive feedback on your strengths &weaknesses.
By attending the practice interviews in InterviewBuddy, You’ll review your answers, body language and communication at any time. This tool can analyze your preparation level for a particular interview and where you need to improve.

In an any interview, The interviewer will analyze your confidence levels. So, you have to boost your confidence levels with interview buddy."
,"If you want to successfully crack the interview, then you should also have your knowledge updated. You need to be aware of present day technology and market scenario."
,"Your question is related for preparation for an interview. Everyone has to pass the phase of interview while he's going for some job. And those who complete this phase successfully they get a job. It's a very simple rule. For knowing this, you should know why people fail in some interview. The reason is very simple, because they lose their confidence.

So if you want to be successful in some interview you should follow the following points.
Be prepared yourself for an interview by reading newspapers daily. Keep in touch with the current affairs and world's present situations. Practice in front of some friends and if they are not available then practice in front of mirror for an interview. This will build up your confidence. Don't interrupt the interviewer in his discussion. It can make him/her furious. Don't try to answer a question when the question is still in progress. If you'll try to show your efficiency in an interview it can irritate the employer. You can prove it later on in your work. I hope you've got the basic and most important points. And you will keep them in your mind. Best of luck."
Can photoshop edit videos?,"Yes, you Photoshop can edit videos from versions CS3 Extended and onwards.  The best versions of Photoshop for video editing, however, are CC and CS6. 
You should note that while Photoshop can edit videos, you should only really use it for fairly simple edits.  For more comprehensive video editing, you should try alternative software, such as Final Cut.  That being said, here's a quick tutorial of how to use Photoshop to edit videos.
How to get started with Photoshop video editing
You firstly need to open Photoshop.
Navigate to to ""Window"".
Click on ""Workspace"".
Click on ""Motion"".
Locate the video file you'd like to edit and drag/drop it onto the Photoshop window.
You're now free to edit the clip.  You can alter audio settings, add filters to the video, splicing the clip into different parts, add a new soundtrack, and loads more.
When you've finished your edit you need to click ""File"", then ""Export"", then ""Render Video"".
That's all there is to it.  Photoshop is more than capable of editing basic video files, but as I mentioned earlier, you may want to look at more comprehensive video editing software such as Final Cut if you're looking to make lots of awesome videos.
Here's a great tutorial for how to edit videos in Photoshop CS6:"
,"I have never use Photoshop to edit a video. In fact, it isn't a professional video editor. You can try a more professional tool which called ApowerEdit."

,"Yes, and even the hallways that lead to them."
,No. I prefer rubber rooms.
,"Hi. I actually painted all the walls of my house after it
was built. I find it beautiful and in terms of aesthetic, it looks perfect to
me. I normally use a special paint that gives a plastic coating to the walls. I
just have to use a wet cloth to clean them whenever it is dirty. I even sprayed
the paint on the outdoor walls in the veranda. "

How To Separate Sound From Video?,You can use a video converter software(eg: Xilisoft Video Converter). Convert the video into WAV.. N play..
,"Adobe Premiere is a world know video editing software for both professional and home users. We can use Adobe Premiere to separate the sound track from video track. Every digital movie has separate tracks for sound and video. A video is a sequence of frames. A single frame is a picture or an image.

If we want to have both track separate then open the movie in the Adobe Premiere. The VCD (.that) file format is not supported by the Adobe Premiere. The movie must be in AVI, MPG or any other supported format. We can convert the file formats by using different video converter software.

Once we have opened the movie, we can seed the project window, a time line and a video window. On the time line we can see the at least two tracks, one for video and for the sound. We can right click of the sound track and then select the save option. The sound track will be saved separately.  Normally, this track is saved in Wave format. We can convert the wave file format to any other file format, if required. This can be done by using the sound converter software. The converter software can be found at download.com"
,"The method of separating sound from video is that first of all by using VirtualDub we will separate from the video and save it in .WAV type. This .Wav file runs through cool Edit 96 and if we want any change, we can edit where required. This tape to which we are converting is recorded in hi-fi stereo, some time one side of the type become higher in level as compare to other side. We will then run .WAV file with the help of Diamond Cut Audio Restoration Tools. This tool is only use to smooth out any impulse noise in our source audio. After this, we will convert this .WAV file in to AC3 by using ffmpegGUI. This GUI has the same rate of bit that TMPGEnc take during the encoding of mp2 in frame serving job. The new AC3 file is same as mp2 in size. Then we will discard the mp2 in favor of AC3 for authoring to DVD.
We can do any sound enhancement with the help of DC-ART. We will start to handle 1st generation tapes. These tapes may be stereo or may be monaural audio."

If 10 AM PST What Time Is In India?,"If it is 10am PST then in India it will be 10.30pm. The time zones indicate that India is 12.5 hours ahead of Los Angeles PST.

How to calculate time zones?
Everyone is aware that there are a number of time zones around the world that represent people on one side of the world waking up while the other people on the opposite side of the globe are going to sleep. It is relatively simple to calculate the various times around the world but you need to make sure you understand the time zones.

Step 1
The first thing you must do is decide which time zone the country you are referring to is in. For example, the vast size of the United States indicates that there are different time zones for the east side of the country and the west side of the country. In this case you will need to discover if you are in the east or west of the Prime Meridian time zone. This time zone line runs through Greenwich in the United Kingdom, therefore anything on the east of the line will be ahead in time whereas the west will be behind.

Step 2
If you are not dealing with a location that can be referred to from the Greenwich line then you should still go through the process of deciding whether the location is placed in the west or the east. The easiest option for you to carry out is to access relevant programs online to help you. There are a large number of time converter websites online that help you discover the exact time of the location you are referring to. Simply type in Google 'time converter' and you will find a list of websites providing this service."

How I Can Convert A Zip File Into A Jpeg Format?,"A ZIP file is a compressed file, which means that it will take up less storage space than an uncompressed file and it can be transferred to other computers much more quickly. There is no difference whatsoever in working with files that have compressed to those that have not. If you find that you need to send lots of different files by email, it makes sense to compress them into a ZIP file so you only have to send one folder as opposed to many files.

If you want to extract a folder or a file from a compressed folder, the first thing that you need to do is to locate the compressed folder. Double-click onto to it to open it, and then drag the folder or file to a new location.

If you want to remove all of the contents from the compressed folder, place your cursor onto the folder and right click it. You then click ‘extract all’ and follow the instructions.

Once you have found the file that you want to make into a Jpeg, simply open it and then click on ‘save as’. Underneath the file name, you will find a drop down menu. Click onto that and you can then just click onto JPEG and then ‘save’.  Be aware, though, that Jpeg files are also highly compressed.

A word of warning about the types of files that you may want to add to a compressed folder: If they happen to be encrypted for security reasons, they will be unencrypted once they are extracted, so you may disclose personal or data protected information without being aware of it. To make sure that this does not happen, don’t compress encrypted files into a ZIP file."

What Does Dssp Stand For On A Medicine Cup And What Does It Equal To?,"As far as I can tell, this is a measure used mostly in the UK, and refers to dessert spoon. At one point, this was approximately 1/2 tablespoon, but has been standardized to refer to a 10 ml measure, while a UK tablespoon is 15 ml. In the US, a tablespoon is 14.79 ml, so it makes a difference what your point of reference is. So, assuming you are in the UK area:

1 Dssp = 10 ml"
,"My medicine cup has markings for 5 different tablespoon measurements and 9 different milliliter measurements. 1 DSSP still equals 7.5 ml (or 1/2 tablespoon) on my modern, translucent plastic cup."
,"DSSP stands for ""dessertspoon"". It is a bit smaller than the tablespoon and a bit larger than the teaspoon."

,"It has been found that certain anti-depressants, known as SSRI's, have the effect of slowing down the nervous system and increasing serotonin, allowing a man to last longer. These drugs work to increase the serotonin in the body, which makes a person feel better, but also lessens arousal by calming the nervous system. One of the unfortunate side effects of PE can be depression, so taking these medications can help with any signs of depression while aiding a man during inter**se. Before taking any sort of medication you should talk to a doctor. Again, taking pills really shouldn't be a long-term solution to PE since it just masks the original problem.

what are the best remedies for skin care?,"Agree with Echo, it depends on what you’re trying to fix. However, you can never go wrong with getting a good sunscreen, exfoliating wash, and nightly moisturizing cream.
You should experiment with different brands and lines until you hit the perfect spot, because since everybody’s skin is different, what works for someone else, may not work for you. Along with drinking water, that completely cleared my acne. Now for even skin tone, just make sure to always apply sunscreen evenly, and don’t stay in glaring hot sunlight."

Light on makeup
Less greasy food"

I really like to do so regularly as it reduces my stress level. I enjoy playing cards and charades with my friends and my cousins. However, since we barely meet nowadays, I try out different online games. Currently, I am enjoying the music quiz on this website: https://www.play-up.co.uk/. You can check it out and repeat it as many times as you want.

,it is not rude because he is your friend
,"YES ... It IS rude to touch anybody without their permission. 
Friend or not.
Just because you think you are friends, does not mean THEY think so ... Let alone that friendship gives you the right to touch them.  Some people are uncomfortable with others touching them, no matter whether they are friends or not.
The polite thing to do is to ask before you touch anyone."
What Special Problems Do Open-ended Questions Have And How Can These Be Reduced?,"(-) Difficult to analyse for researcher with some answers being open to interpretation; Time consuming for respondent answering questionnaire; Social desirability bias with respondent not being completely truthful about their response; Demand characteristics where they try to provide the ’right’ answers rather than voicing their opinion; Some respondents may interpret questions differently; Less comparable than closed-ended questions = difficult to provide quantitative data

Solution: Have a careful Questionnaire design so respondents are clear about what they question is asking = reduces people interpreting questions differently"
,"Not much of  a problem for me, but it may lead to some misinterpretations by some Blurters out there. You should focus your question to one particular subject and not diverse it, maybe that would help."

Is Organic Food Really Good For Your Health?,"Yes organic food is much better for your health. No additives of any kind are added to your food. The key is making sure that the product truly is organic.
For eg. if you have an organic vegetable garden growing in your back yard, but your neighbors also have a veg. garden growing in there in which thy use pesticides, then your garden is no longer organic, because foreign bodies are carried in the air now contaminating your garden veggies."
,"I think it should be good, as organic food contain less chemical things inside, which means less harm to human body. But I don'ts understand why chemicals are bad for human body!"
,"Organic has been scientifically proven to be more nutritional, but it's very important to clean any SOAKABLE food(s) before consuming them in order to remove any paracites or e-coli bacteria. Use the following: Soak any soakable food about 10 minutes in 1 gal. water (preferrably distilled) with 1 tsp. plain bleach. (Be sure not to use scented or other specialty bleaches.) Then soak another 10 minutes in clean (distilled) water. Shake off excess water & enjoy."
,I think it's mainly the environmental friendly ethos behind it and of course because they are not sprayed down heavily with chemicals our bodies don't like.
,"It's a shame that organic food costs more, which puts people off buying it. I'd love to eat more organic food.

I do treat myself to the new Green & Blacks Dark Organic Ice Cream Lolly now and again though. mmmm"
,"No it is not, simply because when you tak a lot of it may cause you dangerous dieases like Ulcers, pnemonia to mention but a few, so it is not good for our health."
,Yes organic food is really good. They do not contain any pesticides or antibiotics.
,"Reducing our use of chemicals is good for the environment - and it is also good for you. Organic fruit and vegetable are grown without the use of pesticides, so when you choose organic, you are lowering the level of chemicals consumed by your family every day.
Doorstep Organics ( www.doorsteporganics.com.au/grown-organically )"
,Organic food uses no chemicals. the usage of chemicals is considered bad because most chemicals that are present in the food are insecticides or pesticides. If such chemicals enter our body in excess it could have disastrous effects.
,"Yes, organic food is good for our health, because it contains many types of enzymes."
,"Yes, Organic food is better for you since there are no chemicals.Not to mention it tastes good,and is good for the enviorment!"
,I only eat organic food and it helped very much with my allergies. That made me positive about organic food.
"If You Won The Lottery Or Inherited A Lot Of Money, What Would You Do With It?","   I would first sit down with my family and figure out how much money they would need to completely get themselves out of debt. Then build them all new homes, nothing fancy but whatever they needed and make sure the taxes are paid up to date maybe longer. For my Niece and Nephews, I would put fifty thousand dollars in a trust fund for each of them to draw from or completely withdraw at the age of 25yrs old, on the condition that they have graduated college or at least in college with a respectable GPA.
Then I would spend a lil on myself. Pay all of my medical bills which is basically all that I owe. Buy a small piece of land near Caverun or someplace like that. Build a small wooden cabin with a wrap around deck. So that I could sit on the porch and drink my coffee in the morning while the sun rises, and grill out on the back deck in the evening and watch the sunset.
Go back and finish school, further my education and graduate college, buy a small business and be my own boss. That's right I would still work. I think I would donate a reasonable amount of money to the Rural Schools in Eastern Kentucky so they could buy new computers and etc. I attended several different schools growing up wealthy and poor. Let me tell you there was a big difference.
Anyway,these are just a few things that I would do if I won the Lottery Or Inherited a lot of money. Hypethetically speaking.   "
,"I would do things for my family that I know are trying to make it but just barely doing so. Make sure my rent and utilities were paid up for a year. Then I would go to the grocery store, and when I see our elderly citizens buying mostly bread and milk, I would walk with them, have them pick out fresh veggies, meat and even a treat.  I would pay for it and move on.     Then the people I know who struggle to pay utilities and medicine /////take them a love offering..    These I would do monthly. There is never a shortage of people who just get by. I can just feel the joy in my heart now and wish I could make it come true.  I am a youngish widow on ss, retire from Nrsg. And someone did things for me, and I know that even having an extra ten dollars makes a poor person feel rich. When all the money is gone, I would be a happy blessed struggling widow again."
,"I have a dear friend who is being forced to sell her house, so I would see that her mortgage would be paid in full.  I'd put money into my niece's and nephew's trust fund for college.  I'd be able to contribute to all those charities I haven't been able give to.  After that, I'm not really sure.  "
,"I would do the best I can for my family. They are always here for me and we are very supportive of each other....
Save most of it for educational purposes within my inner circle...
Invest most of it to ensure return on investments, give some to charity....
Travel...Have fun...!"
,"If I won that much money femployee people in my area and pay them nicirst Id build A really nice house for my children to grow up in.I'm waiting on a one shot deal leg reconstructive surgery I bet it would happen a lot faster If this were to happen to me .I would raise cattle,blueberries And a personal garden for myself and family[we like to eat fresh food]And with my cattle farm And blueberry farm we would ely.We would never want for anything again!!I would also Do what I could For the Hungry we have in our backdoor set up soup kitchens and then make everyone feel welcome to come."
,"First of all, I will thank G-d for the windfall, then, ask HIM to grant me wisdom in the management of such amount of money.
Since I am in a very high state of excitement, under different pressures to buy this and buy that, I will take 3 days before I go to the Lottery Office to collect my cheque. During these 3 days, I will let my mind free to list anything I would always envy to buy (mercedes, sports car, luxirious house, boat cruises, trip around the world, gold necklace and diamonds for my wife, best restaurants, expensive wines, throwing a lavish party)..Then, when my mind is tired of looking for more things to buy, I will take a rest, and chase away any idea of shopping. I will take a white paper, draw 3 columns : On the left side I list those items I deem stupid, in the middle the un-necessary, and in the right the needed. I think, at this point of time, that the bulk of my initial list would be classified as stupid, then few will be un-necessary, and the only thing worthy is the gold necklace for my wife.
Of the $25,000,000.00 I have won, 10% will be set apart to be used as G-d commanded me for any tenth of my income.
Then, I divide the rest equally between me and my wife. I have a rule of 33-33-33-1. It means 33% stay in hard cash, 33% in safe investment such as treasury bonds and gold, 33% in business venture (1/3 real estate, 1/3 stock market, 1/3 reserve funds for these ventures), 1 % to pay for all my debts and to cover my usual expenses.
My goal is that 5 years from now, I will double my asset up to $50,000,000.00. Not all in cash, but in different form.
I'd like to emphasize that I am not quitting my current job, which is doing delivery (I am an independent, and drive my own truck); and I continue to use the money I earn from my work for my regular spendings, instead of taking from the lottery gain.
What could be a problem for me is if my neighbours know about it, and start to behave in a hostile manner. That way, I would move to a more discret, but decent place.
As for the big projects such as saving the world, I have no quick things to offer such as cash donation to charities or foundations. I rather will work for free for people who need a service of transportation during their moving. And, down-to-earth, if I run into homeless and hungry people, I will not give them money but good foods, like let's say a Trio Big Mac, or buy them a bit of grocery (cereals, milk, banana, sliced breads, tomatoe sauce, italian pasta, cheddar cheese, salads).
The long term goal for me is to build creating-job-infrastructures(schools, hospitals, factories) things that will profit many people and generation."
,"Many people do the lottery each week, or even more than once a week, hoping and praying to win. They often ask themselves what they would do with the money, not really expecting to win.
A win of a million pounds would not be an overwhelming win and it could be used to either provide an interest income to enable the winner to give up work and still have a greatly improved way of life, or it could be treated as a windfall with a spend, spend, spend attitude.
Many lottery winners have said that the changes brought to their lives by the huge win have not really brought them happiness. Dolores McNamara, the Irish woman who won ?77 million in the Euromillions lottery in 2005 is reported to be frightened and overwhelmed by all the interest in her. Not only has she found the press interest daunting, her family has been plagued with death and kidnap threats by people hoping to get some ransom or blackmail money."
,"Same thing I said the last time I answered this question  10% off the top to the church and help family ,friends ,neighbors, and relatives anything leftover would go in the bank for a rainy day which we all seem to have a lot of these days....: )"
,"I would pay my house payments on time, but have the house put in my name first so I could work on my credit, and then I would pay the hubbys hospital bills to his heart doctor, and I would take my kids out individually to ask what they want, and decide which they can have, then I would donate to different charities. I love to help people and animals. So that would definitely be done, and I would go to Ireland to fish and vacation for a while."
,"I would invest it, and help family members with it..."
,"Will, I'll give some money to charity,pay my parent's house,
take the whole family on a family trip somewhere, && if I have
some money left over then I'll just save some for back up in case
I need that in the future...&& the rest will just be for me to spend
on some things that I'll need..So yea.."
,"Id totaly buy 2 million packets of pickled onion Monster Munch and put them all on ebay for a penny more than there worth and at the end of my lifetime then I'm going to have a few quid left over for my family to then buy more Monster Munch and put them on ebay for 2 pence more and make a family buisness out of it, way I see it in in 12 generations time we might be able to retire"

What Are The Four Main Structural Components Of Computer And The CPU?,"Most of the people confuse these two different types of components.
The four main components of the computer are:
A: CPU (Central processing unit):
It is the main part of the computer; it performs all the operations of the computer. It is the heart of the computer. It is usually named by the processor.
B: Main memory.
This part of the computer is used for the storage of data.
C: I/O devices.
These devices are used for sending and receiving the data from computer to another device. These are referred as the channel between the computer system and the external world. And also the other peripheral communication lines.
D: System Interconnection.
Lines that connect several components to enable them to perform heir specific operations or some mechanism that is used for the communication between CPU, main memory and the I/O devices.
While the four components of the CPU are:
A: Control Unit: this is the main part of the CPU; it is the part in the CPU which do all the processing.
B: ALU: it is the acronym of Arithmetic Logic Unit, this part of the CPU performs all the necessary arithmetic functions.
C: Registers: this is a small unit in the CPU for the storage of small amount of data.
D: CPU interconnection: there is mechanism which is used for the communication between registers, ALU and Control Unit."

Where Can I Find Bonsly In Pokemon Platinum?,"I don't know if there are any other ways, but I found my BONSLY in the trophy garden. Different pokemon appear in the trophy garden. I go there everyday to check out the different pokemon, that I wouldnt normally see anywhere else. To check what special pokemon is in the trophy garden, go to the man in the purple suit (I don't remember his name). To get to him, go into the Pokemon mansion on route 212. Then, once you're inside, go to the right, and enter the first door you see. There should be a nurse standing next to that door. The guy you need is the one right in front of you (in the purple suit :P) Talk to him, and answer 'YES' to all of the questions he asks (there is only 2 or 3 questions that he asks, I think. He will then tell you about a pokemon that humped his leg or kissed him on the cheek or something. Thats the special pokemon. Then, the old man next to him will run off somewhere. If you need the pokemon that the guy in the purple suit mentioned, go into the trophy garden (at the back of the mansion), and look for him.  He is rarer than the other pokemon there, so it might take you a little while to find it.
Hope I helped :)"

It is important that the data for the primary key are unique, and will remain unique in the future.

Database designers will typically play it safe and just use an auto-increment integer field as the primary key, so that there is never any doubt which row is being worked on.  Even then, you need to consider how large to make the primary key; even a 32-bit unsigned integer may not be enough eventually!"

What Are The Two Types Of Software And Give Example?,"There are two main types of computer software that all computers require to function - system software and application software. System software is the initial software that makes up the underlying functioning of a computer, and provides a platform for applications software to run on. Application software allows computer users to perform tasks and run programs, and could be considered secondary software that builds on primary system software.

System software is the backbone of any computer. It consists of all the files and programs that work to make your computer operate as a computer. System software is automatically provided when you purchase a computer on the high street, and is installed along with the operating system. Providers of system software include Windows and Apple Mac. These offer regular updates which can be installed for free as they become available. Examples of system software include assemblers, system utilities, tools and debuggers.

Application software utilizes the technology provided by system software to allow specific programs to run on a computer. To put it in simple terms, if system software could be considered to be a college timetable, application software could be considered the classes which are incorporated into the timetable. For instance, spreadsheets, word processors and graph templates are all types of application software. Some types of application software are readily installed when you buy a pc. Others will need to be manually installed, through disc or download. There is a limit to how much application software a computer can hold, which depends upon the memory capacity of the computer. What's more, having a large quantity of application software programs installed can slow a computer down. System and application software works closely together to make the modern computer function quickly and effectively; regularly technological improvements ensure the quality of both software types is constantly improving."
,"1. System Software - the underlying software that the computer uses to manage its own internal activities and run application software. It enables the application software to interact with the computer and manages the computer's internal resources.

2. Application Software - software used to perform general purpose task such as word processing software which are used to prepare the next document"

Application softwares are used to improve our work ability. Different application softwares and system softwares are used in daily life. Some are productivity software, content software, assessment software, online software, drill and practice software, problem solving software, tutorials, multimedia softwares, stimulation, games, group ware, share ware, spy ware, free ware etc . Some softwares are used to produce and create documents and different presentations.

Do Most African-American Surnames Come From Their Enslaved Ancestors Owners ?,"It is true that most of the surnames come from their enslaved ancestors but not all. As like momion listed names, I found some of them not from Enslaved Ancestors Owners."
,Yes it is a known fact that most African American surnames come from their enslaved ancestor owners. Its was a fact that was much hailed and promoted during the Afro American struggle for social rights. Even Malcolm X had started using 'X' as the name of that anonymous African ancestor that was smuggled to the American soil.
,"It is true that most of the African American surnames come from their enslaved ancestors owners. However, it is true for only those African Americans whose ancestors were slaves. These slaves took the names of their beloved Masters. Or upon freedom from slavery, they took popular American names. Thus it is usually very difficult to find their actual surnames and thus their history."

What Does LED Stands For?,"Yes, LED stands for light emitting diodes. It serves as an energy source that offers customers an alternative to fluorescent or incandescent lights."
,Led stands for light-emitting diode.
,"Led generally stands for light-emitting diode. It is basically a semiconductor mechanism which produces incoherent thin-spectrum light when electrically inclined in the forward direction.

This effect is a kind of electroluminescence. The colour of the discharged light is usually based on the composition and the condition of the semi conducting substance applied, and can be infrared, visible or near-ultraviolet. In the year 1955 Rubin Braunstein of the Radio Corporation of America initially accounted on infrared release from gallium arsenide and various supplementary semiconductor alloys. Research conducted at the Texas Instruments, by Bob Biard and Gary Pittman, discovered in the year 1961 that the gallium arsenide emitted infrared radiance when electric current was applied.

A LED is a distinctive kind of semiconductor diode, more like a standard diode and comprises of a chip of semi conducting matter impregnated, or doped, with adulterations to obtain a p-n junction."

,"A light-emitting diode ( LED ) is a two-lead semiconductor light source. It is a p– n intersection diode that produces light when enacted. At the point when an appropriate voltage is connected to the leads, electrons can recombine with electron openings inside the gadget, discharging vitality as photons. This impact is called electroluminescence, and the shade of the light (relating to the vitality of the photon) is dictated by the vitality band hole of the semiconductor. LEDs are normally little (under 1 mm2) and incorporated optical segments might be utilized to shape the radiation design.

What Is The Format Of Writing A Hand Over Note?,"A couple of samples to show possible handover letter formats can be found at www.scribd.com/doc/36345680/Sample-of-Handing-Over-Note and www.unrol.org/files/Annex12HandoverNotes.doc. It should be noted that pasting the latter address into the search bar will automatically initiate download of the document.

Writing Handover Notes
Writing a handover note is not as daunting as it may sound. The first step is to jot down basic essential information, such as external and internal contacts; guides to specific computer systems or programs; necessary passwords, although these would be best kept under lock and key until the last minute; documents and where to find them, etc.

Outlining Work
A list of recently completed projects, in case of feedback or queries, as well as outstanding and expected projects should also be prepared. This should include where relevant information, materials or equipment for each project may be located or sourced.

Relevant contact details, both internal and external, as well as completion dates for finished projects and deadlines, timescales, etc for outstanding projects should also be added for each project.
If applicable, financial details should be outlined clearly and in detail.

Polishing the Note
Before finalizing the note, it is advisable to go through all details again and ensure nothing vital has been missed. Details should then be presented in a clear, precise manner.

There is no need to give step by step instructions on how to complete a project. Not only will a successor know how to do the job, they may also have a slightly different approach. Detailing what needs to be done will be sufficient.

All in all, a handover note should not be much longer than three to four pages at most. Any vital documents and files should be attached and clarified."
,"If you click here you will be taken to a search results page. The very first listed result is also the best - if you click where it says 'handover notes' you will then open a document that explains the format of a handover note in detail, and if you scroll to the bottom of this you will come to a template that you can copy and use for your own note."
Useful Tips about Formatting and Other Notes?,"1. The reasons why users need to format their hard disk drive are that they want to free up more space so that they can make good use of it, or they want to remove some errors which happen on the hard disk drive. As we mentioned above, formatting will not remove or erase the data on the hard disk drive forever. But this is based on which formatting method you are using. Basic formatting is the normal one which can be seen or be used in daily life. This operation only deletes some useless information on partition but will not lead to any data loss situation. But the low level will make data loss happen, but don't worry too much-normal users seldom use this kind of formatting method.
2. If users have backup of files, they can easily solve data loss problem which is caused by formatting. But if not, users have to recover lost files by using data recovery software.
3. Backup is one of the best methods to protect files from data loss problem. So just back up the files regularly on a storage device or on cloud service.
Data recovery is a process in which a software is used to retrieve inaccessible data from a storage device such as a hard drive, memory card, pen drive, etc. Retrieval of data may have to be done if the hard drive crashes suddenly, the data is automatically deleted due to a virus, unknowingly deleted by yourself, or the files are corrupted. The primary task of data recovery software is to scan the storage medium to find lost files. Data recovery software has several different recovery algorithms, including Undelete Protected Data, Quick Scan and Deep Scan. It will run through them one at a time until your lost data is found.
Here is a list of best data recovery softwares that I have found:
1. UFlysoft  www.uflysoft.com/data-recovery-mac/
2. Recuva
3. Disk Drill https://disk-drill.en.softonic.com/mac
4. Glary Undelete
5. Panda Recovery

How To Give Self Introduction In Interview?,"Giving a self introduction is all in the title; you should introduce yourself and also let the interviewer introduce themselves.

The best way to give a self introduction is to explain to the people you are introducing yourself to what they should know already. If this is a job or college interview, expand on the CV that they have already seen. Just tell them how you got to this place in your career and where you wish to be going forward. This will show your skills that you have written down and also the skills you possess in being able to expand on a point, as they will know that you can explain where you are and also add in a bit of personality. They will be able to see that you are more than what they have written on their piece of paper about you.

Make sure that you point out all of your good qualities and make sure that if there is anything they already know about you, you acknowledge this and make them feel comfortable that what they already believe is correct.

You should outline the reason why you are there giving this introduction, what drives you to become a part of their workplace of college. Make sure that you are always polite when talking. One of the most important things to do is not to swear and not to use any kind of slang. It's ok to use abbreviations, especially if they are abbreviations associated with their business.

Ensure that at the end of your self introduction you ask them if they have any questions for you and then that way, if you have left a stone unturned and they would like to know more, they can always ask you."

"Which Exercise Is Best Among Yoga, Aerobics, Gym And Others For Good Health?","Aerobics are cardio based exercises, where as gym is cardio and weight training based. All of above are good for you.
 
Yoga is relaxing, strengthens the core muscles (back, stomach) and makes you supple.
 
Depends if you are a stressed person.
 
What I know is that it is good to make your body used to different types of exercises, to challenge your body,as your body can get too used to certain exercises, meaning they might not have the required effect in the long run.
 
Swimming is a very good full body exercise, as it does work the most muscles at the same time.
 
 "
,"Above all, do the one that you take the most joy in. That's the one you'll probably stick with for the rest of your life.

Aerobics covers a lot of ground - running, biking, swimming, etc. Anything that's endurance based and gets your blood pumping can be aerobic. If one of those activities appeals to you, or you like the feeling of getting worn out doing endurance stuff, try aerobics.

Going to the gym and lifting weights will build strong muscles, but it can be hard to stay motivated. Without a class or other people working out with you (like aerobics or yoga) you can lose your motivation. But there are tons of benefits to weight training and getting stronger, and if you need more info about that visit Complete Strength Training, it's got great info about (obviously) strength training.

Yoga is normally taught in classes, giving it a social aspect, as well as having spiritual underpinnings that can be intriguing and fulfilling. Yoga can have more depth than just running or lifting, and get you working out with other people that have similar interests.

There's no best kind of workout, just whatever works for you. Whatever you choose, give it an honest try - at least a month of solid practice. That way you can find out if you really like it, or whether it's not for you.

Good luck,
Aaron"
,"All exercises are good for health, but I prefer Aerobics and Yoga.
Yoga is an aesthetic discipline of exercise which aims to provide physical, mental and spiritual practice to relax mind and body.
Aerobics is a physical and relaxing activity used to train cardiovascular system, heart and lungs to process properly. The aim is to deliver oxygen to every part of the body.

Interview Question: Why Should I Hire You?,"Be confident and with a smile answer this question like:

You should hire me because I believe that I will be an asset to your company. I am hardworking, team player, have a good communication skill,  have what it takes to solve problems and do the job. As you can see by my CV I have the experience which you are looking for this post. Most of all, I am reliable and will always be here when ever the company need  my services. I look forward to be a part of this company."
,"This question (Why should I hire you) when asked at interview is often referred to as an 'ice breaker' because it is a way of getting to know you and is an 'easy' question (in some ways). So you have to deliver the information in an energetic and confident manner, whilst taking care not to oversell yourself.
Usually the interviewers will be looking for standard information, so try phrasing it along the lines of 'I think I would make a valuable contribution to your team. I am hardworking, punctual, I deliver to deadlines and I am very flxible, a good team player, but am able to make decisions and accept resonsibility for my work'. It may then be useful to elaborate on any relevant experience you may have which would be an asset to their company/organisation.
To practise your oral skills before the interview, go through questions which you think you will be asked and formulate your response to them. Then go through these aloud so that you can become more confident. After this go through them with your friends or family, so that they can help you with feedback and Good Luck!"
,"If you want an answer for you interview then be confident and keep a smile on your face. Well now coming to your question Why We Should Hire You

Take few seconds to gather the information and the skills you have related to the job then tell them that

You should hire me because I know I will be a great asset to your company. As you can see my CV I have fulfilled all the requirements related to this job. I am energetic, hard working and always ready to take challenges. And you wont regret to have me as a part of your team."
,"I am a skilled worker who is suited for your company. I am well aware of my skills and interests and feel that we both will gain from our association. I am good, hard working and sincere worker.

I have good communication skills and can adapt and adjust to the new environment well. I am trustworthy human being who is a good listener and ready to help colleagues when required.

My profile is suited to your requirements and you can check with my previous employer about my clean record and I am sure they will give you a positive feedback. I am co-operative and always meet the deadlines and my work is of very high quality. My academic record has been exemplary and is a perfect fit for your concern.

My style of work is very good; I am not intrusive in other's work and ready to lend a helping hand. All in all I am confident that you will not be disappointed with me."
,"I have the ability , knowledge, and good qualification to work in you organisation. Also it can be altered as: Its just because my aim meets with your future plans. Or I am a better candidate meeting all the requirements for the position posted with my additional skill sets of positive attitude, crisis manageable and hard working."

And I can be an asset for your company because I am a motivator and organizer and these skills have enabled me to effectively defuse problem situations. I can maintain records, perform numerical calculations with accuracy and I need little direction from the experienced people to complete assigned tasks. These are the qualities that make an excellent Sales Representative."
,"If you want to sell real estate you should be able to sell yourself.  You will never know as much about any property as you know about yourself.  This is your chance to hit a homerun.
I'm not in real estate but I imagine that selling properties in the present market are the issues that are most on the real estate mind at present.

How do I get my question answered on Blurtit?,"If you ask a question, you will most likely get an answer if someone has the knowledge required to answer it.
However, there are some simple things askers can do to make it more likely they will get an answer:
Have a human avatar (it helps answerers feel like they're addressing someone, or helping someone out)
Ask the question in a clear and concise way. Some questions put people off when they are rambling and incoherent.
Don't be too specific. If you ask something like 'what is the puk code to my Samsung galaxy note with the the phone number 04882044005' - very few people will feel like they can help out.

Whereas, the answer to 'How do I find the PUK code on a Samsung?' might resonate with more people and be just as useful.
Ask something interesting.

Yes, we're here to try and help people out regardless of what the question is - but it's nice to answer interesting questions, so these will always get more attention."

What Are Unstructured Interviews?,"Unstructured interviews are so labeled because the interviewer does not enter the interview setting with a planned sequence of questions to be asked of the respondent. The objective of the unstructured interview is to bring some preliminary issues to the surface so the researcher can determine what variables need further in-depth investigation. Such situation calls for unstructured interviews with the people concerned. In order to understand to understand the situation in its totality the researcher will interview employees at several levels. In the initial stages only broad, open-ended questions would be asked and the replies to them would inform the researcher of the perceptions of individuals. The type and nature of the questions asked of the individuals might vary according to the job level and type of work done by them. For instance top and middle level managers might be asked more direct questions about their perceptions of the problem and the situation. Employees at low levels may have to be approached differently.

Clerical and other employees at lower hierarchical level may be asked broad, open-ended questions about their jobs and the work environment during the unstructured interviews. Supervisors may be asked broad questions relating to their department, the employee under their supervision and the organization."
,"A structured interview is an interview where an interviewer has a preset group of questions that is going to be asked to
each and every candidate in the same sequence.
An unstructured interview is one where there isn't that structure. Where, interviewers are allowed to ask different
questions of different candidates based on context."
,"Job interviews are the most important part of anybody’s career who has chosen to explore working for an organization. Attending an interview is always nerve cracking for an applicant.  There are many types of interviews conducted all over the world.
An unstructured interview can be defined as an interview which does not follow any particular format or style of questions. Even though, interviewer has some predetermined unstructured interview questions to examine the whole pattern might be changed according to the conversation with the candidate or sometimes the interview might proceed according to the candidate’s response. This kind of interview is more like a non-directive interview, and has a friendly approach to it.

,Unstructured interviews are those interviews in which the questions are not prearranged. These types of interviews are also known as non-directive interviews. They are more informal as compared to structured interview. These types of interviews do not have any set format and they are based on the response of the interviewee. Unstructured interviews are much more casual and unrehearsed. If you want to know about the interview tips then you can kindly visit the job portal of Monster Singapore.
How To Prepare For Google Company Campus Placement?,"A campus placement fair is a recent trend followed by many companies. The companies basically tie-up with one another and recruit staff at a common venue. The fair goes on for a set number of days and is beneficial to both, the recruiters and the candidates. The candidates get an opportunity to interact with the HR executives of various companies and hand in their resumes at all the stalls. The recruiters, on the other hand, get to choose among more number of candidates than any advertisement can ever attract.

The Google Company campus placement is a great opportunity for candidates to explore the placements available with a number of companies, all at one place. However, prior planning and a little research help a lot at a Google Company campus placement. The requirements include:
- Multiple resume copies
- Designed and customized web directory
- Updated corporate directory
- Formal dress code

You must be prepared to meet certain heads, as many try and interview the candidates at the campus placement venue itself. The common trend observed today is that many companies prefer wrapping up and completing all formalities at once. The procedures may differ from one employer to another, with regards to the formalities. While some may want to access the documentation first, others may insist on a personal interview. You should keep the day off and remember, 'patience is a virtue'."
How to improve the reading skills of students?,Ask him/her to read some interesting stories books because it will help to develop the reading interest and after that try to read some good novels to improve the reading skills as well as vocabulary.
,Leesa:  Good answer.  You do need to consider the existing reading level when choosing the reading material.  Also (at least it helped me) is to keep a notebook handy and write down each word or reference that you don't know.  My 6th grade teacher claimed that if the book had no unfamiliar words it was too easy for you. 
,"For me, you just need to read and read. Until you can be good at reading"
,"Encourage your students to read selected material and then discuss it in relation to other books, movies, news items, or TV shows. Have your students make the comparison: What did they like about how each format portrayed the topic? How would they have changed a format to better match the topic? What was the message the writers intended the reader/observer to get from the material? Being able to connect what has been read to something else in their lives helps students think abstractly about the material.

If anybody will do like above in particular manner and regular basis then sure you will get good results."
,"SEO is about solving problems. Whether those problems are answering basic questions, providing services, or curing boredom; your webpage needs to be the answer to someone's query. How relevant and helpful your page is to solve the query, in a small nutshell, will determine how it’s ranked.
So be helpful. Be relevant. Not just to the humans, but help even those incredible machines over at Google need help too. So do some of the following:
Make unique content
Be original with your content. Posts like this and inbound marketing, in
general, contain much of the same answers everywhere you look. Why
should I share, read, or click on your content versus the 1,000,000
other results given in the search engine? Be different and engage your
audience in new ways.
Get backlinks
Larry Page came up with the idea for PageRank when he was at Stanford. He found that when people referenced certain peer-reviewed articles and documents for research papers, this acted as a kind of vote for that article.
In a nutshell, this is how backlinks were first counted in PageRank; the more votes you had the better your page ranked. The algorithm is much more sophisticated now and has a multitude of different ranking factors, but the core idea still remains: Get backlinks from respected and authoritative websites and you’re ranking will increase.
Target long-tail and short-tail
Ranking well for short tail will bring you a lot of traffic. Ranking well for
long-tail may bring you a lot of traffic depending on the search volume;
however, long-tail will bring more targeted traffic and result in more
conversions and less bounce-rate if your site offers them value.
Short-tail means more competition, but if you can muscle your way up the SERPs it will be great for brand awareness. If you can also rank as a Featured Snippet it can mean a bump in traffic and higher CTR in some cases.
Update your content
If you post content and notice that it’s not ranking well after a while,
then update it. Keep an eye on your competitors and let that be a
barometer of where you want to be in the SERPs and try to find things they may have missed you can add to your content to outrank them.
Run optimization checks and get feedback from users about your content to see how you can improve it.
Don’t ignore social media
While engines like Google don’t adhere to social signals as ranking factors, they can still help things like your bounce and click-through-rates to the signal that people do find value on your website.
Furthermore, the more exposure your content has, the more it can be viewed by others and possibly used in their own content.
Give high importance to Facebook Twitter and Google plus. If your content gets engaged in these sites easily, then your ranking will increase quickly and thus your website will get exposure.
For social media services regarding these sites visit SMM Boost Service.
Be patient
SEO is one of those things that takes a lot of time and energy. You ’re going to screw something up eventually, but don’t despair. Keep working hard and it will pay off eventually. Use white-hat techniques only. Black-hat may provide you with some short-term value, but the outlook long-term isn’t good as Google will catch you. They almost always catch you."

How do I get a police officer to help me with a prank?,"If it is something that will put the cop or department in a bad light, they will not help. But your best bet is to just ask."
,You don't. They have better things to do with their lives then to play games.
,That's a good way to get arrested for criminal mischief.
,"You simply ask, if your polite about it, the worse they can do is say no. Although if they say yes they could lose their job and all their credibility  (meaning they can never be a cop again) best bet would be to just go buy a cop costume"

"So to make a long story short. My ex friends with benefit/lover we hooked up this past weekend. And,  out of all the guy's I have been with in the past sexually. He's one of the few ones, that knows my body really well, and what turns me on sexually. But anyways, I have noticed this, when we did have sex frequently a lot more in the past this always would happen. It's like, anytime that him and I do have sex it's like the day afterwards or the day after that I still feel the need of wanting more sex. And I don't know if that's normal to still feel the need and the urge to want more sex. Btws, Someone said that he's not doing his job right, then another person says it is normal. But again, anytime that we have hooked up in the past, and now back at it again lol. We end up going two rounds. So what could be the problem here, is it me or is it that the sex between us is not that great or grant?","According to you, he knows your body really well.
I'm guessing that means he brings you to (the big O).

,"So basically I have a Co worker, who I joke with. One day he was out, it was the day after his birthday, and I texted him ""how'd I know you were gonna be out? Lol."" Now, I was just messing with him and he knows that. Today was a week after I texted that and we went at it a little bit, then he brought up the message and mentioned reporting it on me. Was the message I wrote a harassing one? And what is the worst case scenario for it? Also, he jokes with me all the time but in a sense he's harassing me for it. I don't understand the NY rules completely, but could I sneak a recording sometimes when he's joking around in a harassing way? Or in general, could I sneak a recording?

My daughter had to put her bunny to sleep today. ?? She is broken hearted. What words will help if any? Or is it only time that heals?,"I am so sorry. Putting an animal to sleep is one of the hardest and one of the kindest things to do. It takes putting your beloved pet's well being and comfort above your desire to hold them. There is no doubt that time is going to be their biggest help in dealing with the loss.
I have had to put one dog down. I knew it was coming, so that helped prepare me. But afterwards the thing that helped me most was talking about the silly things he did. I was laughing and crying at the same time. So maybe have everyone talk about their favorite memories. 
Another is to look for signs that the bunny may send to let her now it is ok. Some people say seeing a cardinal is a sign of a some who has passed is checking in. Or maybe if the bunny liked munching on dandelions, one pops up . You know something that would be special to the bunny. The night after I had to put my boy Thor to sleep, Arabella and I were in bed and she started snoring. She NEVER snores. Thor ALWAYS snored. I knew that a sign that Thor was ok.
Hugs to you and your family."
,"Awe I'm so sorry!:(
Lots of good advice here already Yin. I found only time helps and letting them talk. Hugs to all."
,I'm sorry Yin. Give her a big hug and let her know her bunny is not in pain anymore.
,"I m so sorry for your loss.
Just tell her how much u love her, and u know how much she loved bunny. It would help for her to know that bunny loved her and showed this love by not being afraid.
Remind her of all the cute things bunny would do.
Mention how u feel abt bunnys loss.
After that, it will take a lot of time.
Find ppl who have also had to put their animal down. You love them all, regardless of wether its a cat, a dog, a horse or a bunny."
,Here comes peter cotton tail hopping down the bunny trail. Im so bunny for a lost bunny.
,"No real advice, just a hug to pass along to her.  So sorry, Yin!"
,"Awww, just tell her that the bunny would thank her for not letting it suffer in pain anymore. That is sad :("
,"I'm so sorry for everyone's loss. He sounds like he was a cherished member.
Hippy game me great advice once when he talked about a little family memorial service. Have a little service for him with all who loved him so, talk about him, maybe eat his favorite human foods. Have the kids friends come over if they have some memory to talk about and want to. Maybe a little memorial out in the backyard. A stone or a special rock. Whatever speaks to your daughter. Just throwing out some suggestions. Everyone has their own ideas on those rituals. A celebration of his life and the joy he brought you and your daughter,, a little acknowledgement, a respectful tribute to a critter who brought your family all that he did.
Hugs to you and your family, Yin."

Apps from gameloft.com and the play.google.com store are also used to kill time, but that’s only when I have my dad’s Android tablet around.

But I of course love it since it's helping me lose weight easier but can you tell me what that is and called. Also, is there any side effects if I continue to lose weight with it?"
,"You are negatively programming yourself to not eat sugar rather than positively encouraging yourself to be healthier in your food choices,  the messages you give yourself affect your mood and your body.  Losing weight doesn't mean depriving yourself of little amounts of what you enjoy, it means maintaining a balance.  If you treat yourself in this way you are in essense bullying yourself and no one likes to be bullied. I guess your are feeling this doom and gloom programming in your gut."

Otherwise, you need to learn something called COLD CALLING. Call random places around your house and ask if they're hiring even if they don't have hiring signs or job posting. Who knows? Maybe they'll go ""Hmmm. Maybe I do need some help."""
,"I am in the same situation too, its really hard to find a job everywhere. Because all the employers need experienced candidates but at this time I am not having much experience because I am a newly graduate, I don't know about you.

,"So you are finally looking for ways to
advertise your website without appearing as spam, then you should take a look
at the following 5 tips. These tips have been collected by experts from SEO and
web design services Dubai has to
offer, and they are effective enough to take your website from zero to hero,
with time. The tips are as follows
1.
Go organic with SEO – it is
true that paid activities, though effective, appear as spam to many users on
the internet. This is because, the campaign managers at times end up targeting
a large group of audience, and several keywords, thereby causing spamming and
wastage of budget. But, if you were to invest in SEO services that any web design company Dubai has to offer,
then you will end up increasing the rankings of your websites naturally,
without appearing as spam.
2.
Blogger Outreach – This is one
of the latest and effective methods of making your website popular on the
internet through word-of-mouth. Any blogger, having a network of followers, can
be approached for promoting a website, and you get niche audience, without
being a spam.
3.
Emails after signup – Yes,
subscription based emails, and listings in limited emails that offer value to
users will keep you from being a spam.
4.
Genuine blogging – link
building done through useful blogs, and proper linking will aid in making your
business genuine on the internet.
5.
Creative Advertising – if the
SMS, emailers, and other buzzing modes of reaching out are implemented
creatively, you will not appear as spam."
,"Spam can be defined as irrelevant or unsolicited messages sent over the Internet. These are usually sent to a large number of users for a variety of use cases such as advertising, phishing, spreading malware, etc.
In the past, spam used to favor email as it was the primary communication tool. Email addresses were relatively easy to harvest via chat rooms, websites, customer lists and that impact a user’s address book. Eventually, email filters became more sophisticated, and more effectively decreased spam from clogging the inbox.
Since then, spammers have moved onto a new target: Social applications.
Fake accounts are key to social spamming: To gain credibility, these fake accounts will try to become ‘friends’ or follow verified accounts, e.g., celebrities and public figures with the hope that these accounts befriend or follow them back. When genuine accounts befriend or follow back fake accounts, it legitimizes the account and enables it to carry out spam activities.
Another way for spammers to attack is to hack into and take over a user’s account, spreading fake messages to the user’s authentic followers.

,"A person who has embarked upon the Hajj pilgrimage is known as a hajji or hajjah. A hajji is honoured in his or her community. For many people, the thought of being respected amongst the other members of his or her community prompts them to perform the Hajj. The term hajji, in fact, is translated as honourable pilgrim in the English language.

Hajj, according to the teachers of Islamic religious studies, is an expression of one's devotion to God and not a means to gain a higher status in society. This sentiment is reflected by a prayer which is known as the talbiyah prayer. The faithful should examine his or her beliefs and intentions before performing the pilgrimage and constantly strive for self-improvement. In spite of suffering a lot of physical hardships, the pilgrims who complete the Hajj successfully consider it to be one of the greatest spiritual experiences of their lives."

What is the difference between living in a house and living in an apartment?,"There are many main differences between living in an apartment and a living in a house. A house is usually on the ground floor and has an upstairs and a downstairs. In a house, there is normally (but not always) a kitchen, dining room and living room downstairs, whilst the bedrooms and bathroom are upstairs. In an apartment, which is usually in a block, so raised above ground level, all of the rooms of the house are on the same floor (unless the flat has a mezzanine level).

Apartments can often be as expensive, if not more expensive than houses. Houses often come with garages, where as apartments can usually only come with a parking space. Houses often have gardens out the front and out the back. The size of the gardens depends on the size of the property itself. To some people, apartment living is a more stylish and less traditional than house dwelling. In major cities, apartments are often city dwellings whereas houses are the located in the suburbs."
,"I don't think there aren't any big difference in these two except maybe for comfort. Normally apartment is smaller than a typical house. It can be a 2-storey adjacent flats or a flat within a building. The not so good about living in an apartment is that, your home is only separated by walls and your unit is side by side so basically you can hear noise from your neighbours. While house is commonly understood as a detached unit. Depends on the size, there is more room for privacy too."
,"House is bigger apartment is smaller
apartments are rented or leased
apartments usaly have other people living there
houses are quiter"
,"Not exactly sure what you are asking.
But:
Houses can be rented just like apartments.
Some houses are smaller than some apartments.
There are many apartments on the ground floor unless the building has a ground floor reserved for commercial enterprises.
Not all houses have an upstairs and a downstairs."
,Houses are your qwn propertyand you have to manitain of your own and thats your permanent place.But apartment you rent it for shorter time and is also smaller in size than the houses.
,"Normally a house is bigger than an apartment which situate in the town more than in the suburb, I like to live in a house, because it's more spaces and comfortable for doing somethings, inviting people or hold a party etc... There's also a garden where we can plant some flowers, fruits and vegetables etc... So for me I can find many things to do there."
,"There is huge difference between living in a house or living in an apartment .Apartment are rent But house is your own property.. In house there is common like rooms are individually bedrooms, bathroom,Kitchen, Dining room and lobby . In an apartment there is single block involves all rooms... House are bigger than apartments."
,You have a vested financial interest in a home and only rent an apartment.  You can do pretty much what you want to renovate or maintain your home .. But have to get permission from your landlord to make changes or improvements to an apartment.
,"Living in an apartment, I don't have to worry about lawn maintenance, and if something breaks down, I call the office and they fix it. I also do not have a water/sewage bill, nor do I have to worry about getting the garbage to the curb on pick-up day. The only big disadvantage is sometimes the neighbors can be a bit loud."
,"Leaving
a house is the fully personal area where you have own garden and all
the other thing in a house like bedroom, guest room kitchen etc. These
all things are yours. But an apartment is different from the house in an apartment, there are many people living in a single building you have only specific area is given to live."
,"Firstly, there is obviously a major difference in size. When you have more space, you will have enough room to accommodate each and every single one of your needs and others living in the house with you. However, it would also mean that you will have a high tendency of owning more items which could cause a clutter if cleaning is not done on a regular basis."
,"Hi
there! I lived in houses for most of my life, apart from the time when I was
studying in London. Apartment-living will be more restrictive in various ways
and one will also have to get used to being closer to neighbours and be able to
respect them all. On the other hand, a house will often come with fencing all
around, a back and front garden and it will be more spacious in general. This
will obviously be more convenient if you have a larger family and you will also
have more freedom."
,"Some of us prefer to live in an apartment
whereas some other love to live in a house. Living in a house or an apartment
is just a matter of preference and can change from person to person.  However, there are few important benefits that
living in an apartment. I have been living in an apartment in Kochi for more
than twelve years now and believe that there are many advantages of living in apartments in Cochin.
Life in an apartment can offer you
many benefits and advantages when compared to the life in a house. To know more
click here."
,"There are so many differences between
living in a house and living in an apartment. Since I have been living in an apartment
for a very long time, I would only prefer apartment further also. Apartments
provide more security and it is easy to socialize even keeping your privacy. All
the amenities you need can be accessed at apartments and you don’t need to make
a space for such things at your place. Trinity Builders Cochin has the best apartments
with all the basic amenities and spacious ones which makes you feel like home."

And you want to be part of professionals. And you like working in a professional environment doing more challenging jobs."
,Because I am interested in the organization and want to have an outstanding achievement in the organization.

Learn about your career goals and how this position fits into your plan
Make sure that you are sincerely interested in the job and will be motivated to perform if hired
Find out what you know about the company, industry, position (and if you took the time to research)
Understand your priorities and preferences — which aspects of the company and/or job are appealing to you and why?
A good answer will demonstrate a knowledge of the company and industry. That means you must do your homework so that you can identify specific reasons for wanting to work for the firm.
These reasons could include one or several of the following:
Company general reputation
Reputation of key leaders
Admiration of products/services
Admiration of other company initiatives (marketing campaign, community involvement, training programs)
Company awards
Company management philosophy
Company values
Company positioning in market

How To Clear HR Round In IT Companies?,"The first thing that you need to clear any HR interview is confidence and faith in yourself. Before going for an interview prepare for it by brushing up your skills and your knowledge. Then dress appropriately for the interview and remember the maxim ""first impression is the best impression"". The interview would generally start with general question as to your name, work experience and the rest.

Then it might move on to the more specific details as to why are looking for a change and some other queries which would help them to determine your knowledge and skills. Answer them confidently and be honest and clear. Do not try to show off or try to be something that you are not. Be yourself and do not be afraid of making mistakes. Though it is bad to make mistakes it is worse to have a bad attitude. Thus it does not require any extraordinary skills to get through an HR interview."

,"There are myriad of ways that you can make your reputation strong and influential. When you hold any event or any gathering, it becomes important that you give importance to little things. It is really vital that you pay attention to things that do matter."
,"Hiring cleaning services should be done meticulously. You need to be sure that you are actually hiring credible folks to work in your home. You cannot just allow any kind of person to come into your home, can you? Besides, you should ensure that the cleaners are really going to offer you a great and invaluable service. Evaluate their service, their portfolio and what they stand for and make sure that they are really the best around with respect to your budget and needs.
If you are poised at hiring the best home cleaners, these checklists will guide your steps on the right path and help you not to fall into a ditch.
Do They Offer a Satisfaction Guarantee?
Satisfaction guarantee is simply a way a service provider proves that he offers services that would satisfy the customer. With a satisfaction guarantee, you can be sure that the cleaning service is worth it and you can confidently put in your money. In some cases, the cleaning company will refund you if you are not satisfied with the service. This means that you will not lose your money in the process. You can confidently leverage such a service.
Do they hire contract workers or have full-time employees?
This may not seem necessary, but it is really important. You are safer in the hands of companies that have full-time employees but you should be wary of those that hire contract workers. Companies spend significantly lower amounts of money in hiring contract workers. The contract workers are replaceable and they know it; this makes it very difficult for them to be dedicated to the job but this is not the case with full-time employees.
Be sure of the cleaners you are hiring
Before hiring cleaning services, MN, you need to really be sure of the cleaners you are hiring. Remember that your home is your most sacred space and you cannot afford to let any kind of person in the home. This makes it important to properly study the person or people you are hiring to be sure that they worth the risk. Go through the company’s references, ensure that a background check is run on the workers and make sure that the workers do not have any criminal records.
Get Your Own Cleaning Supplies
Some cleaning companies have their own cleaning supplies, but some others do not. However, whether the cleaning company would come with their cleaning supplies or not, it is usually better to have your own cleaning supplies. This is very important if you are considering the safety and health of your home. Most importantly, you should be critical of the cleaning solution used by the company. You can get a green cleaning solution before hiring the company and ensure that the company uses the cleaning solution. This will keep you on a safer side and prevent any odd circumstance from occurring.
By following these checklists, you can ensure that you hire the best cleaning services.

,"So basically I have a Co worker, who I joke with. One day he was out, it was the day after his birthday, and I texted him ""how'd I know you were gonna be out? Lol."" Now, I was just messing with him and he knows that. Today was a week after I texted that and we went at it a little bit, then he brought up the message and mentioned reporting it on me.

What would you do if you were faced with this situation? (Details below. Sorry it's so long.),"My dad's still in the hospital but the doctors say his kidneys are stable as of yesterday. Here is my dilemma... My dad wants to sign himself out against medical advice (AMA) He says if i dont get him out of there he will crawl out Monday. I dont blame him, however on one side a cat scan shows (the doctor thinks) my dad had a mini stroke when he was home. He wants to run some more tests. My dad can not eat because everything burns his esophagus. He swallows water and ice just fine. Its not a swallowing problem. He hasn't eaten since December 31st and the dr wont give him nutrients through the IV because of his kidneys. I managed to get him to eat a yogurt and half of a nutrient filled fruit drink. For about two weeks he hasn't been able to walk. About a week he can't stand. I am working on helping him sit and stand right now. If he comes home I don't have the confidence in myself that I could care correctly for his chest catheter they put in for dialysis or the wound on his foot. I fear ""what if"" he falls out of bed being so weak still. On the other hand... I fear leaving him in the care of the hospital when I'm not there. So far I have caught 2 MAJOR mistakes 1 being another patients name on my dad's medicine (yes I checked the medicine was correct, just the patient was mixed up) and another time the nurse swore my dad had his oxygen on after he came back from a procedure. It didn't look on to me. She said no it's on. I said okay?.... Then she actually checked to see if it was on and IT WAS TURNED OFF! I don't know how long he was with out the oxygen! It caught my attention because his o2 numbers on the blood pressure machine was beeping and I noticed it beeped everytime it went below 90! They didnt catch the beep OR the oxygen being off! Yesterday when I went to see him (I was able to go an hour and a half after a phone call from the dr.) He sat in poop for an hour THAT I KNOW OF! Then his nurse lied to me saying she just checked him and changed him when he was sitting in the chair 45 mins before I showed up and he was fine. She did not know that THAT was the reason why the doctor called me... Because dad was refusing to sit in the chair for him.... I spoke to the Dr AFTER the chair and an hour and a half BEFORE I got there! She did not have him checked and tended to while in the chair 45 mins prior because then WHY would the Dr call me saying he is refusing to sit in a chair and he can't release him till he does! Grrrrr! What would you do.... Try to convince him to stay? Or be his ride home on his own AMA? How do you tell your parent no? And yet how do I feel he is in the best care at this negligent hospital!? I'm so torn!"
,"That's a tough one, Yin
Personally, I never had to parent my parents---and quite frankly, I probably would not have been able to do so successfully on my own due to the dynamics in my nuclear family before I left for college.
It's important to have options. Would a transfer to another hospital for treatment be possible?
Beyond that, I fear I have no useful advice.
If you have a few minutes to stop thinking about it, asking JC to help you arrange your thoughts in an approppriate way for evaluation usually works well for me."
,"I think you need to speak privately to your father's doctor and tell him exactly what you've told us.  Tell him that you feel compelled to report the nurse's negligence, and ask for his help in relocating your dad."
,"If you don't have a POA (Durable Power of Attorney) then there isn't a lot you can do on their behalf.
I went through this with both my father and just recently with my Father-in-Law. The problem is they get to the point where they still think they are fully cognitive and capable of making decisions regarding their own health and finances. It is important to for these discussion to happen long before you get to a point where you end up having to fight for ability to help your parent.
Currently, my Mother-in-Law has a nurse come in to check on her once a day. To get her up, and start the day, but my wife and I have to take care of her finances and get her to doctor's visits and grocery shop (for prepared foods because she can barely run a microwave).
This is not the best place to be in but you will make it through. If anything it has shown my wife and I that we need to have things in place long before we get to that point in our lives for our children."
,Good answers here i will pray for u
,"Yin, I am so sorry you and your family are dealing with this. If possible I would look for another facility. Either an assisted living facility or another hospital. Some place you can get a second opinion, and care you don't need to worry if they are doing everything right. Prayers for you, your father, and your family. ((((HUGS))))"
My question is long so it won't fit here so look at the comment of this question?,"I'm starting to lose weight but what motivates me to doing it. Is by thinking of a reason of what gives me doubt and it makes it easier of avoiding sugar and eating healthy but if I do eat sugar or something sweet I lose that motivation it feels like it's in my stomach and it feels like a dark doubt. But I of course love it since it's helping me lose weight easier but can you tell me what that is and called. Also, is there any side effects if I continue to lose weight with it?"
,"You are negatively programming yourself to not eat sugar rather than positively encouraging yourself to be healthier in your food choices,  the messages you give yourself affect your mood and your body.  Losing weight doesn't mean depriving yourself of little amounts of what you enjoy, it means maintaining a balance.  If you treat yourself in this way you are in essense bullying yourself and no one likes to be bullied. I guess your are feeling this doom and gloom programming in your gut."

How To Prepare For Campus Interviews.?,"Campus interviews can be nerve-racking. It may be the first time you have seen the college or university for the first time - so besides new surroundings you are dealing with lots of questions! Remember, however, that college and university representatives may want to impress you as much as you want to impress them.

A campus interview is a chance for the institution to present itself to students. Therefore, a campus interview is not only about sharing information about yourself. It is also an opportunity to learn about the college or university. This simple fact may put you more at ease.

To prepare, do some research about the university or college and try to see how you would fit in. What could you bring to the university or college? Also try to articulate to yourself what your goals and dreams are for the future. Universities and colleges like nothing better than when their graduates succeed in the world, advertising their alma mater in the process."
,"First check out the companies you're about to attend.Then collect all the previous placement papers of those companies.Then practice for those type of questions.Mostly you'll have objective type of questions where in you have to select the answer from given options.Practice well on Aptitude part as it carries more importance.Buy a 'Agarwal' Book if your in INDIA.Else practice on following type of problems:

*)Time and Distance

*)Ages

*)Time and Work

*)Percentages

*)Profit Loss,etc..

Then have some idea of answering questions based on verbal and comprehension where in you need to answer questions which are based on the paragraph given above.You have to read those paragraph answer those questions.Also look for Synonyms and Antonyms.For that you can refer the

""GRE preparation by Barrons"".

Also prepare for Logical questions
All The Best !"
,"The concept of 'campus' or campus placement is relatively recent in origin, but very beneficial to the recruiters and candidates alike. The candidates get an opportunity to access every possible job opportunity they qualify for. The recruiters, on the other hand, get to meet and interact with more candidates than most of their offices could ever accommodate or any classified could attract.

It is important for a candidate to be well informed about such placement opportunities, well in time. The announcements are made in newspapers, on television, the cable or the radio. However, most aspirants find out about the 'fairs' from friends. It is essential to indulge in a little research prior to visiting the venue. You need to get together certain documents and update information. You need to identify your basic skills and vocational pursuit. You can't end up looking confused at an offer or procrastinate. You also need to highlight on paper and verbally, your academic qualifications and career planning goals. Always keep in mind that most of the opportunities would require you to present your best at one shot. There is little or no time to prepare once you are there. Carry along many copies of your resume and try and gather as much information as you can about the companies present at the venue. This would give you a chance to customize your approach.

Never forget to take along your self-esteem and confidence. They are your most valuable assets."
,"The interview questions are based on your subject skills. The interviewer will check your technical skills and communication skills, moreover confidence levels. Before attending the interview you can practice interview questions through some career guidance websites or practice mock interview in real-time. But, I prefer online mock interviews because practical knowledge is better than theoretical knowledge.
As my suggestion, online practice interviews are the best way to practice the interviews. It will help to boost your confidence for the actual interview. I would like to suggest InterviewBuddy-(Online mock interviews with experts) is the best online platform to practice any stream of an interview and you can get industry experts feedback. It will help to know the actual interview process and questions."
,To attend campus interviews confidently visit www.tipsoninterview.com  and read interview tips prepared by experts.
,You should refer to sites like www.chetanasinterview.com and www.freshersworld.com/a> and refer aptitude books like that by R.S.AGGARWAL and verbal from BARRONS.
How To Prepare For Technical And HR Interview?,"The best way to prepare for a technical or HR interview is to try to determine what types of questions a potential employer may ask you and how you would formulate your response to these questions. You should never attend any interview without having at least a minimal degree of preparation. Even if you are not sure what you will be asked, be certain to find out a little about the company you are interested in working for and, when appropriate, try to weave in bits of information about the company into your answers. This will show that you are prepared, truly interested and can take the initiative.

For HR interviews, expect to be asked about your previous work experience and what you have learned from this, as well as your specific skills. If you are just out of university, talk about internships you may have taken, as well as any volunteer work. Be sure to mention that you have good technical writing skills and that you are able to prepare technical reports and presentations with ease. These are key to most HR jobs."
What To Wear To An Airline / Cabin Crew / Air Hostess / Flight Attendant Interview?,Very formal clothing
,I would wear  nice silky pants suit.
,"I will wear a skirt suite,stockings and shoes"
,"Men’s Interview Attire:
SUIT:
Light Colored Jacket and Pants
Wear a simple shirt collar, such as a traditional straight point or a slightly less dressy button-down, avoiding tab collars, pins or wide English spreads. Also avoid monograms or jaunty contrasting white-collar-and-cuffs. And no French cuffs, which will help you avoid any cuff link mistakes.
TIE:
The tie is extremely important, since it is the first thing someone notices in a man’s outfit. An all-over, neat pattern, a small dot or a classic stripe all work well. Avoid anything wild, overly bright or statement-making.
Ties with simple repeating patterns can be good for a job interview as long as those patterns are as simple as possible.
KNOT:
A knot type to use on an interview will depend on a shirt collar you chose, as well as on the type of the tie and your own face structure.
SHOES:
black lace-up shoes are far better than casual penny loafers or anything gimmicky with buckles or straps. Never underestimate the importance of a good shoeshine. And black socks only, ones that are long enough to cover your ankles if you cross your legs but not bulky.
The shoes should be neat and well-polished.
SOCKS:
1.Your socks should match the trousers and/or shoes and be possibly solid and dark in color. The rule of thumb here is that socks must not draw people’s attention.
JEWELRY:
When it comes to jewelry, the main thing to remember is that the simpler and less of it – the better. Wedding rings, of course, are always acceptable.
WATCH:
Avoid wearing digital, sporty watches, as well as those overwhelmed with various dial plates, huge tachymeters, world time zone plates etc.
It is better to use a watch with a leather band, but in the United States a metal one is acceptable too.
BELT:
A belt should be made of leather and match the color and possibly the quality of leather on your shoes.
HAIR:
Trimmed and freshly combed hair.
No Spikes
NAILS:
Nails should be clean.
Fragrance:
A very little of cologne can be okay. Do not apply too much of it for an interviewer not to suffocate if in a small room, where you might be interviewed. Anyway, it is still advised to use some neutral-smell.
Women’s Interview Attire:
Pick something classy if you don't wear a suit:
Pick a suit that fits you well and isn't too flashy. Stick to darker colors
Clean and iron your outfit.
Conservative shoes:
Don't pick something you can't walk in. If you don't like heels, stick to something low and basic.
Don't wear too much jewelry:
Keep it simple. For instance, a small chain and a pair of smallish earrings. In addition, don't wear too many rings.
No jewelry is better than cheap jewelry.
Don't go overboard on makeup:
Go for a more natural look, and don't go overboard on designs or colors.
Pick a natural, neutral concealer to hide flaws, followed by a neutral powder to help take care of shininess. Use blush that goes with your complexion; usually warm pink or peach is a good choice.
For your eyes, a light brown or one slightly darker than your skin tone can add dimension without looking like you're wearing eye shadow. You can use eyeliner, but try light gray and just lightly dot it on your upper eyelid.
Finally, choose a lipstick or lip tint that is basically the same color as your lips.
Keep all of it light. Basically, you want to look like you're not actually wearing makeup, but you want to even out your skin tone and add a bit of color.
Professional hairstyle:
Simple hairstyles are better.
Perfume:
A very little of cologne can be okay. Do not apply too much of it for an interviewer not to suffocate if in a small room, where you might be interviewed. Anyway, it is still advised to use some neutral-smell.
Nails:
Neatly manicured clean nails
Carry a briefcase:
1. If you have important papers to carry, don't forget to add a professional-looking briefcase. Use a dark color, and try to pick one that's more modern. Leather is always a nice choice.

What’s the future of medical marijuana without serious research?,IDK
,
,"Seems like a good investment, it will boom in my opinion.."
What would you do if you were faced with this situation? (Details below. Sorry it's so long.),"My dad's still in the hospital but the doctors say his kidneys are stable as of yesterday. Here is my dilemma... My dad wants to sign himself out against medical advice (AMA) He says if i dont get him out of there he will crawl out Monday. I dont blame him, however on one side a cat scan shows (the doctor thinks) my dad had a mini stroke when he was home. He wants to run some more tests. My dad can not eat because everything burns his esophagus. He swallows water and ice just fine. Its not a swallowing problem. He hasn't eaten since December 31st and the dr wont give him nutrients through the IV because of his kidneys. I managed to get him to eat a yogurt and half of a nutrient filled fruit drink. For about two weeks he hasn't been able to walk. About a week he can't stand. I am working on helping him sit and stand right now. If he comes home I don't have the confidence in myself that I could care correctly for his chest catheter they put in for dialysis or the wound on his foot. I fear ""what if"" he falls out of bed being so weak still. On the other hand... I fear leaving him in the care of the hospital when I'm not there. So far I have caught 2 MAJOR mistakes 1 being another patients name on my dad's medicine (yes I checked the medicine was correct, just the patient was mixed up) and another time the nurse swore my dad had his oxygen on after he came back from a procedure. It didn't look on to me. She said no it's on. I said okay?.... Then she actually checked to see if it was on and IT WAS TURNED OFF! I don't know how long he was with out the oxygen! It caught my attention because his o2 numbers on the blood pressure machine was beeping and I noticed it beeped everytime it went below 90! They didnt catch the beep OR the oxygen being off! Yesterday when I went to see him (I was able to go an hour and a half after a phone call from the dr.) He sat in poop for an hour THAT I KNOW OF! Then his nurse lied to me saying she just checked him and changed him when he was sitting in the chair 45 mins before I showed up and he was fine. She did not know that THAT was the reason why the doctor called me... Because dad was refusing to sit in the chair for him.... I spoke to the Dr AFTER the chair and an hour and a half BEFORE I got there! She did not have him checked and tended to while in the chair 45 mins prior because then WHY would the Dr call me saying he is refusing to sit in a chair and he can't release him till he does! Grrrrr! What would you do.... Try to convince him to stay? Or be his ride home on his own AMA? How do you tell your parent no? And yet how do I feel he is in the best care at this negligent hospital!? I'm so torn!"
,"That's a tough one, Yin
Personally, I never had to parent my parents---and quite frankly, I probably would not have been able to do so successfully on my own due to the dynamics in my nuclear family before I left for college.
It's important to have options. Would a transfer to another hospital for treatment be possible?
Beyond that, I fear I have no useful advice.
If you have a few minutes to stop thinking about it, asking JC to help you arrange your thoughts in an approppriate way for evaluation usually works well for me."
,"I think you need to speak privately to your father's doctor and tell him exactly what you've told us.  Tell him that you feel compelled to report the nurse's negligence, and ask for his help in relocating your dad."
,"If you don't have a POA (Durable Power of Attorney) then there isn't a lot you can do on their behalf.
I went through this with both my father and just recently with my Father-in-Law. The problem is they get to the point where they still think they are fully cognitive and capable of making decisions regarding their own health and finances. It is important to for these discussion to happen long before you get to a point where you end up having to fight for ability to help your parent.
Currently, my Mother-in-Law has a nurse come in to check on her once a day. To get her up, and start the day, but my wife and I have to take care of her finances and get her to doctor's visits and grocery shop (for prepared foods because she can barely run a microwave).
This is not the best place to be in but you will make it through. If anything it has shown my wife and I that we need to have things in place long before we get to that point in our lives for our children."
,Good answers here i will pray for u
,"Yin, I am so sorry you and your family are dealing with this. If possible I would look for another facility. Either an assisted living facility or another hospital. Some place you can get a second opinion, and care you don't need to worry if they are doing everything right. Prayers for you, your father, and your family. ((((HUGS))))"

If a package is delayed will it eventually still arrive in?,"Check with the company that you bought it from and shipped it to you. Sometimes they will full refund, partial / refund or make some kind of amends for your package being late."
,"It depends on where the delay is. If it has been shipped and there is a delay along the way, you will get it as soon as whatever caused the delay is cleared up.
If it was delayed from being shipped, it may or may not show up eventually depending on the cause of the delay. If it is because it is on backorder, sometimes things come in, and sometimes they get discontinued. "

So if you can be happy today
Be happy today!"
,One day at a time
,"I think you are over thinking it. Most of my relationships lasted 6 months or less. It wasn't out of fear of falling in love, it was the knowledge that the person wasn't someone I wanted to make a life long commitment with. If you aren't sure after 6 months, then you will never be sure. You just take each relationship as a learning experience. You learn what you like and what you don't like. Then when you do meet the right person, you will know.
So many people rush into what they think is love and end up with a lot of problems later. Take your time and learn about the person and yourself. When the right one comes along, you won't run."

"So I'm a strong catholic believer, but i don't know where i stand on homosexuality. I'm all for people being themselves, and loving who they love, but the bible is clear that it's wrong, what should my opinion be? Love is love but i'm told its wrong","The part of the Bible that is ""clear"" is Leviticus. It is also the part of the Bible that also tells you not to mix your fibers or grains. So If you want to go with it, empty you closet of all the cotton/polyester clothes you have, and throw out the multigrain bread you have.  Oh and also no more shrimp or lobster for you either. Shellfish is a no-no as well. The bible also says slavery is okay. All of this is in the first testament. Jesus never said anything about homosexuality, but he did say we should love one another."
,"These are positions you should decide for yourself, as you must be aware, what we might think about other people and their life choices has no bearing on them. 
Belief is the practice of accepting without evidence, following the ideals of others. In this case, you cite scripture, but choose to honor only certain bits of the whole (Gator Blu gave good examples). That you choose to live this way in your faith is as small a matter to others as is your stance on their personal preferences.  
Shoe on the other foot: What of others' opinions of your Catholicism, does it bother you that there are those who find fault with this? Would you have them impose their positions on you?
Food for thought..."
,"If you are a believer then leave it up to God. 
Here is some food for thought...
Homosexuality practices were often associated with Pagan Temples of other gods which maybe why it is classed as an abomination in the bible. God saw the body of a person as a temple of God.  That a child can only come from male and female union.
Many pagan religions still believed intercourse had to be between a man and a woman as this signified the earth and heaven union.
Your bible states that woman came from man. In Jewish Midrash, Adam was both male and female, therefore Eve was taken from Adams side, hence why a woman must be joined to a man in marriage or sexual union in order to become one flesh.
The Catholic Church had many priests who committed abominable acts with children over many years, and have still not held those accountable, but just moving them to different areas of the church, I don't think it can stand in judgement of others.
Homosexuality and even paedophiler was permitted or ignored in Rome.  Socrates was a pederast. Hence, homosexuality may have an unfortunate stigma of being associated with paedophiler due to history.
Not all homosexuals engage in sodomy.
If your children were homosexual would you love them any less?"
,"The Bible was written as a guide, not a rule book. Let your heart be your guide and believe what's in it, not what was written thousands of years ago."
,"I am a Catholic (cradle, now 71 years old), so let me take a shot at this.
When I was a teenager and young adult, homosexuality carried quite a societal stigma.  I have always been heterosexual, and that was well buttressed during my upbringing by the extant dislike (more like disgust, I fear) of homosexuals.
I was always taught ""Hate the sin, lover the sinner,"" so I always had a way to separate the 16 year old who stole the package of gum from the store and the 16 year old active homosexual from what they did and still ""love"" them in the general way that adolescents can sort of understand that concept. 
I have had a great and sustained interest in theology and psychology since I studied both formally.  I was also abused as a child (NOT sexually) and that has always tended to make me want to understand the motivations of those who perform actions that for whatever reason are judged (whether rightly or wrongly) harshly by the society in which they live.
Bottom line---for years, I have actively sought to wrap my mind around homosexuality.  About four years ago, I realized that it was highly unlikely that I would ever be able to do so, so I told God (literally) that I thought that perhaps homosexuality was not something I needed to understand.
And if you can't understand something, it's hard to have an informed personal opinion about it.
So, here is my present approach to homosexuality---currently I do not have a personal opinion on it, nor do I have a responsibility to formulate one at present.
Beyond realizing that homosexuality in and of itself does not assure the continuation of the species, I do not understand how it fits into anyone’s daily life, but  I certainly do not fear homosexuality.  Interacting with homosexuals as fellow humans is easy---after all, I’m human too.  As to other questions, e.g., morality and legality, I leave that dialogue to those in the appropriate fields.
Love is an act we perform.  The genital component of love is a separate issue.  So are ""feelings.""  (Just a heads up for understanding.)"
,"I was going to make a point similar to Gator Blu, but I believed she expressed it better than I would have.
If you decide to believe that homosexuality is wrong anyways, I want to encourage you to be respectful of gay people anyways and act like a decent person. While you don't have to agree you still have to respect them and leave them alone regarding it.
When I was still religious, I was also homophobic, it was actually this flowchart that changed my mind about it:"
,"So, as a believer, do you embrace ALL the teachings of the Bible?
There are some that hold the Ten Commandments in high regard (both Sets with second one being very odd), and then there are some that attribute Eating Shellfish, Bacon, getting your hair cut with rounded edges, Beard Cut, Mixing fabrics (Poly/cotton blends included) and wearing jewelry to be part of Mosaic Law, and not relevant to us now . . . Both are from the Old Testament, and the Commandments (including Thou shalt not kill, and Thou shalt love no other God before me) are just as much part of Mosaic Law.
If anything, the Christian ""Belief System"" tolerance has had to adapt (Yes Evolve) to mold itself to CURRENT Cultural norms. Often, those who are against things like homosexuality, have made this a ""Personal Preference"" with regards to their subjective World View. They only use the Religious text that most closely align with what THEY feel is appropriate behavior and disregard the parts they do not personally agree with.
In the end, you get to decide. You can maintain your belief system, and only regard the scripture that aligns with your World view, and disregard the rest as tired Old text relevant only to the day and age of its creation."
,Megan I am also catholic and I have nothing wrong with that and if that's what you believe then I think its alright. Your right. With all people being themselves . I don't see anything wrong with that at all.
,As a Catholic it's not your place to judge others God loves all of mankind and all of mankind sins. In the Popes first year he was asked about a certain gay priest in the Vatican and the Pope replied who am I to judge them awesome answer.
,"It is sad that people who claim to be Christian love and accept what God clearly said is wrong not only in Leviticus 18:22, ""You must not lie down with a male in the same way that you lie down with a woman. It is a detestable act.""  Also in the New Testament at 1CORINTHIANS 6:9-11 says ""Or do you not know that unrighteous people will not inherit God's Kingdom? Do not be misled. Those who are sexually immoral,idolaters,adulterers,men who submit to homosexual acts,men who practice homosexuality, thieves,greedy people,drunkards,revilers,and extortioners will not inherit God's Kingdom.  And yet that is what some of you were. But you have been washed clean; you have been sanctified; you have been declared righteous in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and with the spirit of God.""  Even though it is an accepted practice in the world today it is not with God. The Bible was written for all people no matter what time period they have lived on earth."
,"Dear Megan,
I find this question very interesting as well as the
comments that have been posted.  Since
you are a devout Catholic, I’m sure you view the Bible as God’s Word.  So, to truly get the answer to your question,
you will have to decide how much do you trust God’s Word and what is written in
it.  Many of the answers posted have been
based on how society views homosexuality, but as we all know public opinion
changes.  What is accepted today may not
be that way tomorrow.  But the Bible has
not changed on its stance about homosexuality, no matter how ones may try to
change the view of the matter.  At 1 Corinthians
6:9, 10 helps us to appreciate God’s view; Or do you not know that unrighteous people
will not inherit God’s Kingdom? Do not be misled. Those who are sexually
immoral, idolaters, adulterers, men who submit to homosexual acts, men who
practice homosexuality, 10 thieves, greedy people,
drunkards, revilers, and extortioners will not inherit God’s Kingdom.
We all remember the
account in book of Genesis the 19th chapter about Lot and what took
place in Sodom and Gomorrah.  We do well
to remember that these 2 cities were destroyed because of their unhealthy
appetite of homosexuality.  Lot even
offered his virgin daughters in place of the men (who were angels in the flesh)
but the men, all the way from young boy to old man refused and demanded that
the men be brought out so they could have sex with them. 
For those who may
say that the old testament of the Bible is outdated, this proves to be false
because God does not change on how He views matters that He considers a sin.  2 Timothy 3:16 helps us to see that: “All Scripture is inspired of God and
beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for
disciplining in righteousness, so that the man of God may be fully competent,
completely equipped for every good work.”
So, Megan if you
trust in what the Bible says and not the view of man, you should be able to
make a well conscience decision on how you will view homosexuality and whether it is right or wrong."
Its natural blonde brownie day. And celebration of life day.what is a blonde brownie????????????????????????,"I LOVE life and will celebrate that everyday!!!! ??
This is a perfect time to celebrate life because my dad's kidneys seem to be on the road to recovery!!!!!! ????????"

The only other option is a troop of Brunette Brownie girls are all stealing their mother's Hair coloring products . . . "
,"Blonde brownies are similar to the traditional brownies known almost everyone. In place of cocoa, brown sugar is used, giving it a sweet-tooth-satisfying molasses flavor!
Never have seen or tasted one.
Being alive is always worthy of celebration."

What would you do if you were faced with this situation? (Details below. Sorry it's so long.),"My dad's still in the hospital but the doctors say his kidneys are stable as of yesterday. Here is my dilemma... My dad wants to sign himself out against medical advice (AMA) He says if i dont get him out of there he will crawl out Monday. I dont blame him, however on one side a cat scan shows (the doctor thinks) my dad had a mini stroke when he was home. He wants to run some more tests. My dad can not eat because everything burns his esophagus. He swallows water and ice just fine. Its not a swallowing problem. He hasn't eaten since December 31st and the dr wont give him nutrients through the IV because of his kidneys. I managed to get him to eat a yogurt and half of a nutrient filled fruit drink. For about two weeks he hasn't been able to walk. About a week he can't stand. I am working on helping him sit and stand right now. If he comes home I don't have the confidence in myself that I could care correctly for his chest catheter they put in for dialysis or the wound on his foot. I fear ""what if"" he falls out of bed being so weak still. On the other hand... I fear leaving him in the care of the hospital when I'm not there. So far I have caught 2 MAJOR mistakes 1 being another patients name on my dad's medicine (yes I checked the medicine was correct, just the patient was mixed up) and another time the nurse swore my dad had his oxygen on after he came back from a procedure. It didn't look on to me. She said no it's on. I said okay?.... Then she actually checked to see if it was on and IT WAS TURNED OFF! I don't know how long he was with out the oxygen! It caught my attention because his o2 numbers on the blood pressure machine was beeping and I noticed it beeped everytime it went below 90! They didnt catch the beep OR the oxygen being off! Yesterday when I went to see him (I was able to go an hour and a half after a phone call from the dr.) He sat in poop for an hour THAT I KNOW OF! Then his nurse lied to me saying she just checked him and changed him when he was sitting in the chair 45 mins before I showed up and he was fine. She did not know that THAT was the reason why the doctor called me... Because dad was refusing to sit in the chair for him.... I spoke to the Dr AFTER the chair and an hour and a half BEFORE I got there! She did not have him checked and tended to while in the chair 45 mins prior because then WHY would the Dr call me saying he is refusing to sit in a chair and he can't release him till he does! Grrrrr! What would you do.... Try to convince him to stay? Or be his ride home on his own AMA? How do you tell your parent no? And yet how do I feel he is in the best care at this negligent hospital!? I'm so torn!"

How do I get a police officer to help me with a prank?,"If it is something that will put the cop or department in a bad light, they will not help. But your best bet is to just ask."

Its natural blonde brownie day. And celebration of life day.what is a blonde brownie????????????????????????,"I LOVE life and will celebrate that everyday!!!! ??
This is a perfect time to celebrate life because my dad's kidneys seem to be on the road to recovery!!!!!! ????????"
,Life should be celebrated everyday!
,Blonde brownies (also called blondies) are usually more brown sugar and/or caramel tasting .... Delicious!
,"I don't understand Why it's Natural Blonde Brownie day . . .
Are there actual Brownies who dye themselves to look less chocolaty?
The only other option is a troop of Brunette Brownie girls are all stealing their mother's Hair coloring products . . . "
,"Blonde brownies are similar to the traditional brownies known almost everyone. In place of cocoa, brown sugar is used, giving it a sweet-tooth-satisfying molasses flavor!
Never have seen or tasted one.
Being alive is always worthy of celebration."

None of us is guaranteed anything, celebrate what you have now, anything could change tomorrow."
,Don't worry about tomorrow.  Live today.

What does it mean when a minister shares bible verses with a women?,"Q ""What does it mean when a minister shares bible verses with a women?""
Errmmm... The ""women"" does one half of the verse and the minister does the other half?
For example if the verse is 1 Corinthians 11:6 “For if the woman be not
covered, let her also be shorn: But if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or
shaven, let her be covered.” then the ""women"" does the uncovering and the minister does the shaving?
The uncovering would presumably be in the church. Not sure where the shaving would be though.

Are supply chain management strategies important?,"Of course they are. Supply chain management involves the oversight of goods from supplier to manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer to consumer. You don't want to waste money in this process. By being aware of all the things involved in the movement of the goods, you can keep costs down aloowing for a lower price to the consumer and a bigger profit for the companies."
,"Supply chain management touches major issues, including the rapid growth of multinational corporations and strategic partnerships; global expansion and sourcing; fluctuating gas prices and environmental concerns, each of these issues dramatically affects corporate strategy and bottom line"
,"Supply chain management is a major player in product customization, quality control, cost reductions, and speed-to-market. Therefore, an effective supply chain management strategy is important to implement in order to have a smooth transition of products throughout your supply chain. Please visit@ www.iiscm.org/"
What Is Chain Polymerization?,"The most important types of chain polymerization are radical polymerization, ionic polymerization, and insertion or coordination polymerization. Three steps characterize each method of polymerization. The start reaction or initiation, the growth reaction, and the termination reaction. The first reaction step, i.e. The initiation, is the formation of a reactive radical or ion9. This requires, in general higher activation energy than the subsequent growth reaction in which the monomers add to the growing chain. Consequently the growth rate is very much higher than the rate of initiation.    Nomer is activated and opened up so that it can for new bonds and then after the reaction with another monomer it becomes saturated e.g. Ethylene becomes –CH2-CH2–  Bi-functional monomers polymerize into linear chain molecules and a thermoplastic material is obtained. Monomer with two functional groups results in cross linked polymers, such as thermosets and elastomers. The termination step can occur either by two growing polymer chains combining with each other in radical polymerization or by addition of a terminating agent or a modifier whose function is to combine with the reactive end of the growing chain and thus saturate its reactivity. Modifying or termination agents can be by products or impurities or specifically added substance that reacts with the reactive end of the growing chains."
,Chain-growth polymerization or chain polymerization is a polymerization technique where unsaturated monomer molecules add onto the active site of a growing polymer chain one at a time. Growth of the polymer occurs only at one (or possibly more) ends. Addition of each monomer unit regenerates the active site. Pls visit@ www.iiscm.org/
,It is characterized by the self addition of monomer molecules to each other very rapidly through a chain. Their is no by product formed. The product is of same elemental composition as that of monomers. In chain polymerization bi functionality is provided due to the presence of double bond.

Currently, my Mother-in-Law has a nurse come in to check on her once a day. To get her up, and start the day, but my wife and I have to take care of her finances and get her to doctor's visits and grocery shop (for prepared foods because she can barely run a microwave).
This is not the best place to be in but you will make it through. If anything it has shown my wife and I that we need to have things in place long before we get to that point in our lives for our children."

Can anyone learn a foreign language?,Yes. You should not expect it to be easy (it’s not) but anyone can learn a second language just like anyone can learn a first language.
,"Hello
there! I am sure that anyone can do so. It is not easy at the beginning, but
once you’ve got a good teacher and you put the time into it, it will be
alright. I remember the time I tried to learn Cantonese. Everything looked like
drawings at first, but after only one month, I was able to read and understand
the language. The main problem for me was the fact that I could not pronounce
the words properly. I suppose that if someone put an hour a day to learn a new
language, it is possible."
,"Hi there! Of course, with the number of specialised software that are out there, it’s very easy for anyone to learn any foreign language that they might be interested in. I have myself managed to learn Hindi, Chinese and Malay using one of these software. Do some research to spot the thing that will suite you best!"
,"Anyone can learn a new language with a bit or maybe more effort. It's important to find suitable methodology to do that and a motivation. This might sound obvious, but if you don’t have a good reason to learn a language, you are less likely to stay motivated over the long-run. Wanting to impress English-speakers with your French is not a very good reason — wanting to get to know a French person in their own language is another matter entirely. No matter your reason, once you’ve decided on a language, it’s crucial to commit.

How To Do Muscle Control When Having Sex?,"The muscle control you are referring to is known as 'kegel exercises'. This process uses the pelvic muscles, which in turn improves the control of the bladder as well as improving the sensation during sexual intercourse.

Pleasure during intercourse
You can do these exercises during sex as it will increase the pleasure of the act. By doing this, the pelvic muscles will contract stronger which will eventually lead to better and more intense orgasms. In order to do this correctly, you should squeeze and release your pelvic muscles during intercourse to increase your pleasure.
The muscles
In the majority of cases, after giving birth or going through the menopause, the pelvic muscles, one of which is known as the pubococcygeus, can become stretched and loosen. This will ultimately result in a small loss of bladder control during activities such as laughing or coughing.
How to do kegel exercises
You may find it difficult to start doing these because these particular muscles cannot be easily identified due to their remote location, so you may not be sure if you are contracting and releasing properly. The best way to practise is when you go to urinate. In this case you should contract the muscles by stopping the flow of urine and then releasing. They are the kegel exercises and once you have identified them you can do them at any time, however, do not confuse these with buttock clenches."
,I am no expert on this but if a man does it you will last longer during sex and when a woman does it makes her seem tighter.
,"Practicing specific exercises that improve ejaculatory control. Kegel, for example, is one of the best known exercises that help to strengthen the PC muscles in your pelvis region. Once these ""love muscles"" are strengthened, you can stop an approaching ending either by contracting these muscles or simply keeping them relaxed.

What does it mean when a minister shares bible verses with a women?,"Q ""What does it mean when a minister shares bible verses with a women?""
Errmmm... The ""women"" does one half of the verse and the minister does the other half?
For example if the verse is 1 Corinthians 11:6 “For if the woman be not
covered, let her also be shorn: But if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or
shaven, let her be covered.” then the ""women"" does the uncovering and the minister does the shaving?
The uncovering would presumably be in the church. Not sure where the shaving would be though.

Why do some people think you'll go to hell just for being gay? Like can't you have an opinion over who you want to love??,"You ask:  Like can't you have an opinion over who you want to love??
So, you imply being gay is a choice you can make---do you believe that?"
,"people misinterpret the bible, thinking that being gay is a sin. Also, people (christians) throw their beliefs on others and it sucks. I personally have experienced hate while i was at a private christian school because i was gay. The only thing making people believe that your sexual orientation is a sin is beliefs and ignorance."
,Some would say that being gay is a demon that can be cast out.
,"Because they pick and choose what Bible verses to believe .. And the Old Testament in Leviticus says that homosexuality is a sin deserving death. 
Of course, it also says not to eat certain things or wear clothing made of multiple materials ... Which they conveniently ignore."
,B cuz the Bible says in 1st Chorinthians 6:9 that homosexuals will not enter the kingdom of God
,Your sexual orientation has nothing to do with hell or heaven because both don't exist. You live right and do whatever makes you happy without hurting other. Hell or heaven created by you with the kind of living you do.
,"If you are referring to one of the three monothestic religions the reason it was frowned on was because homosexuality was often seen in temple prostitution to other gods such as Ishtar. It is the homosexual act that is ""taboo""often translated as an abomination in the bible.
It is also noted that when man and woman join in love they become one flesh.
In Genesis 2:22 Woman was made from man's rib/side. In Jewish Midrash Adam or Adama was both male and female androgenous.
The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken from the man, and brought her to the man. The man said, ""This is now bone of my bones, And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man."" For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.

http://thetorah.com/the-making-of-adam/
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse_of_Adam
Genesis 2:24
Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: And they shall be one flesh.
Mark 10:8
And they twain shall be one flesh: So then they are no more twain, but one flesh.
Cor 6:16
Or do you not know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body with her? For He says, ""THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH.""
Eph 5:28 - 29
So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself; for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church,
Even in tantric sex the union must be between man and woman which is eastern belief."
,"Opinions seem to communicate Choice. Can you choose who you fall in love with? When did I choose to be heterosexual . . .
That being said, Most holy Scriptures have a problem with Same sex relationships. It was either misunderstood be the original writers, or Simply meant that the union would not produce fresh off-spring to Indoctrinate and keep the religion moving forward.
No Gods are required for men to produce texts to control the masses by fear of an invisible eternal punishment.
Lucky for them I guess . . . Becaue no Gods could be found."
,"Q ""Why do some people think you'll go to hell just for being gay? Like can't you have an opinion over who you want to love??""
Let's start with what you have boiled it down to: ""can't you have an opinion over who you want to love??""
If, say, it's just a handful of you on an Island by yourselves where no rules apply [extremely impractical, of course] then perhaps you cannot only have an opinion over who you want to love, be it your neighbour's wife, daughter or son, [or even all three] or what you want to smoke or snort but you can go ahead and act on that opinion.
However, if you want to organise yourselves into a smoothly functioning society then you will need rules or laws for the wellbeing and future of your society. Even in the most liberal of societies you will have limits beyond which you cannot put your opinions into practice. In the more conservative ones you might be taken to task for just expressing certain opinions, let alone acting upon them.
If a society enacts a certain law it will stipulate what it considers appropriate punishment for any breach of the law. Where a law accepted by a society comes from, or is claimed to come from, an external source [federal, international or ""God""] then that source will most likely have stipulated what it considers appropriate punishment for any breach of the law [be it imprisonment, lashes, stoning or a spell in hell, or any combination thereof]."
,"I'm a Catholic, but I have to say that I don't believe in a lot of things that the Church teaches.
First, I believe that an individual's relationship with God is between that person and God, and nobody else.  This is why I do not believe in confession.  First of all, God will know what sins I have committed, and he will know if I am repentant.  What reason is there to go and confess your transgressions to another human being?
As far as going to Hell when you die, I believe that only people who are evil and have committed evil deeds while they were alive wind up going to Hell.
Even if you never went to a mass in your entire life, but you are a good person with a kind heart, then you are going to go to Heaven.
Being gay certainly does NOT make you evil.  You are allowed to love who you want to love.  If that happens to be another man or another woman, or both, so be it.
I firmly believe that what determines where you go in the afterlife depends fully on how you treated other living things when you were on Earth. 
If you were malicious and you constantly hurt others and aimed to destroy the happiness of others, then you will reap what you sow."

How To Do Muscle Control When Having Sex?,"The muscle control you are referring to is known as 'kegel exercises'. This process uses the pelvic muscles, which in turn improves the control of the bladder as well as improving the sensation during sexual intercourse.

Pleasure during intercourse
You can do these exercises during sex as it will increase the pleasure of the act. By doing this, the pelvic muscles will contract stronger which will eventually lead to better and more intense orgasms. In order to do this correctly, you should squeeze and release your pelvic muscles during intercourse to increase your pleasure.
The muscles
In the majority of cases, after giving birth or going through the menopause, the pelvic muscles, one of which is known as the pubococcygeus, can become stretched and loosen. This will ultimately result in a small loss of bladder control during activities such as laughing or coughing.
How to do kegel exercises
You may find it difficult to start doing these because these particular muscles cannot be easily identified due to their remote location, so you may not be sure if you are contracting and releasing properly. The best way to practise is when you go to urinate. In this case you should contract the muscles by stopping the flow of urine and then releasing. They are the kegel exercises and once you have identified them you can do them at any time, however, do not confuse these with buttock clenches."
,I am no expert on this but if a man does it you will last longer during sex and when a woman does it makes her seem tighter.
,"Practicing specific exercises that improve ejaculatory control. Kegel, for example, is one of the best known exercises that help to strengthen the PC muscles in your pelvis region. Once these ""love muscles"" are strengthened, you can stop an approaching ending either by contracting these muscles or simply keeping them relaxed.

No one knows what tomorrow holds
So if you can be happy today
Be happy today!"
,One day at a time
,"I think you are over thinking it. Most of my relationships lasted 6 months or less. It wasn't out of fear of falling in love, it was the knowledge that the person wasn't someone I wanted to make a life long commitment with. If you aren't sure after 6 months, then you will never be sure. You just take each relationship as a learning experience. You learn what you like and what you don't like. Then when you do meet the right person, you will know.
So many people rush into what they think is love and end up with a lot of problems later. Take your time and learn about the person and yourself. When the right one comes along, you won't run."

What is the benefit social media marketing?,"These are the top 7 benefits of Social media Marketing:
1. Increased Brand Awareness
Social media is one of the most cost-efficient digital marketing
methods used to syndicate content and increase your business’
visibility. Implementing a social media strategy will greatly increase
your brand recognition since you will be engaging with a broad audience of consumers.
To get started, create social media profiles for your business and
begin interacting with others. Get employees, business partners, and
sponsors to ""like"" and ""share"" your page. Simply having people interact
with your content will increase brand awareness and begin building your reputation as a business. Each post that is shared will be introduced to a new network of individuals, which can lead them to becoming potential customers, and the more people who know about your business, the better.
By investing only a few hours per week, over 91% of marketers claimed
that their social marketing efforts greatly increased their exposure.
There is no doubt that by simply having a social media page your brand will benefit, and with regular use it can generate a wide
audience for your business.
2. More Inbound Traffic
Without marketing your business on social media, your inbound traffic
is limited to your usual customers. The people familiar with your brand
are likely searching for the same keywords you already rank for.
Without utilizing social media as part of your marketing strategy,
you’ll have much more difficulty reaching anyone outside of your loyal
customer circle.
Every social media profile you add to your marketing mix is a gateway
to your website, and every piece of content you post is another
opportunity to acquire a new customer. Social media is a melting pot of
different types of people with varying backgrounds and behaviors. With
different people come different needs and different ways of thinking.
Syndicating your content on as many platforms as possible allows
these individuals to organically reach your business. For instance,
perhaps someone in an older demographic of consumers will search for
your website using a particular keyword on Facebook, but a millennial
could begin their search by using a different social media platform
entirely, because they search for products totally differently. By
marketing on social media you can effectively open your business to a
wider variety of versatile consumers all over the world.
3. Improved Search Engine Rankings
Although posting on social media might get your business some site
traffic, more effort than that is required to see significant success. Search Engine Optimization
is very important for achieving higher page rankings and obtaining
traffic to your business website. While social media doesn’t directly
increase search engine rankings, Social Media Examiner states that more than 58% of marketers who have been using social media for one year or longer still see improved search engine rankings. Being able to rank in the top positions for your keywords will revolutionize your traffic and continue to generate positive results for your business.
To give yourself the best chance of ranking better through social
media, create high quality content that integrates your targeted
keywords. Content such as blogs, infographics, case studies, business
information, and employee photos will make your business’s social media profile intriguing and credible. Once you begin posting quality content, you’ll begin to build a social media community where followers will ""like"" and ""share"" your content. Most importantly, it gives you more
opportunities to get in front of industry influencers who will write
about your business and provide links back – which will help to directly
increase search engine rankings.
4. Higher Conversion Rates
With increased visibility, your business gains more opportunities for
conversion. Every blog post, image, video, or comment may lead viewers to your company’s website and increase traffic. Social media marketing allows your business to give a positive impression through a
humanization factor. When brands are interactive by sharing content,
commenting, and posting statuses on social media, it personifies a
brand. People prefer to do business with other people, rather than
companies.
Over 51% of marketers claimed that taking the time to develop
relationships with consumers showed positive results in sales. The
better impression you make on a visitor, the more likely they are to
think of your business when the need for your product or services
arises.
Studies have also shown that social media has a 100% higher lead-to-close rate than outbound marketing. When a brand is interactive online, consumers who follow your brand’s accounts often begin to more completely trust the credibility of your business.
5. Better Customer Satisfaction
Social media is a networking and communication platform. Creating a
voice for your company through these platforms is important in
humanizing your company. Customers appreciate knowing that when they post comments on your pages, they will receive a personalized response rather than an automated message. Being able to acknowledge each comment shows that you are attentive of your visitors’ needs and aim to provide the best experience.
Every customer interaction on your business’s social media accounts
is an opportunity to publicly demonstrate your compassion for your
customers. Whether an individual has a question or a complaint, social
media allows you to address the matter using interpersonal dialogue. A
brand devoted to customer satisfaction that takes the time to compose
personal messages will inherently be viewed in a positive light, even if
responding to a customer complaint.
6. Improved Brand Loyalty
One of the main goals of almost all businesses is developing a loyal
customer base. Considering that customer satisfaction and brand loyalty typically go hand in hand, it is important to regularly engage with consumers and begin developing a bond with them. Social media is not just limited to introducing your brand’s products and promotional
campaigns. Customers see these platforms as a service channel where they can communicate directly with the business.
The millennial generation is known for being the most brand loyal
customers of all. Born between the early 1980’s and the early 2000’s,
millennials are the largest generation in US history -– and will soon
completely consume the market. Studies show that this Segment
of customers is 62% more loyal to brands that directly engage with them on social media. Since these technology natives require communication with their brands, businesses must implement social media marketing to get the attention of their most influential consumers.
7. More Brand Authority
Customer satisfaction and brand loyalty both play a part in making
your business more authoritative, but it all comes down to
communication. When consumers see your company posting on social media, especially replying to customers and posting original content, it makes you appear more credible. Regularly interacting with customers
demonstrates that your business cares about customer satisfaction, and is available to answer any questions that they might have. Satisfied
customers are eager to spread the word about a great product or service and they usually turn to social media to express their opinion. Having customers mention your business on social media will advertise your business, and show new visitors your value and brand authority. Once you obtain a few satisfied customers who are vocal about their positive purchase experience, you can let the advertising be done for you by actual customers who enjoyed your product or service."

what are the best remedies for skin care?,"Agree with Echo, it depends on what you’re trying to fix. However, you can never go wrong with getting a good sunscreen, exfoliating wash, and nightly moisturizing cream.
You should experiment with different brands and lines until you hit the perfect spot, because since everybody’s skin is different, what works for someone else, may not work for you.

What's The Importance Of Hair Care?,"Hair is the crown of the human body. This is the beauty of a person's personality. Hair care is very important. It does not matter how gorgeous you are if you ignore your hair. Good hair care contains simple steps like brushing and combing, shampooing and drying, treating baldness, hair conditioning, dandruff, hair dyes, split ends and hair loss treatment and some other methods. We can start hair care from home. With right care and interest you can bring back its vitality and glossy shine.

• Brush your hair before shampooing to eliminate the tangles.
• Brushing is less damaging than combing but a long brushing can also damage the hair.
• Back combing is also harmful for the hair. It causes knotting which is not easy to untangle.
• Always use a good comb if you feel more comfortable in combing. A good comb can be categorized as a comb which have rounded and soft teeth.
• Nylon brushes with pointed ends also break the hair.
• If you are suffering from the Dandruff-the most common problem, immediately get rid of it by applying good and suitable hair oils.
• Keep your head clean. Don't neglect the hygiene of head.
• Use good shampoos and conditions for healthy looking hairs. Nutritious shampoos are the best choice because hairlessness is caused due to insufficient nutrition."
,"All individual appearance is essential to most peoples. I'm summing up, however, Western modern culture puts a major accentuation on style for nearly everything, particularly personal appearance. Additionally, people both deliberately and subliminally influence internal judgements about individuals they see, so hair and other style can actually change the way people see each other.

What Kind Of Music Did Michael Jackson Sing?,"Michael Jackson's music spanned a number of genres, but the vast majority of his work is pop music, hence his title as the ""King of Pop"".

Michael Jackson is the most successful entertainer of all time, and was a global figure in pop culture for 40 years. He began his career in 1964, forming a band with his brothers called The Jackson 5, and beginning his solo career in 1971.

He is known for his distinct vocal style, complicated dance techniques and his pioneering use of music videos.
Michael Jackson died in 2009 (of propofol intoxication) at the age of 50 in his Los Angeles mansion. His doctor had found him not breathing but with a pulse, and started CPR immediately. Paramedics were called, but Jackson was pronounced dead at the local hospital shortly after.

Since then his doctor has been convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to four years in prison. The coroner ruled that the doctor had accidentally given Jackson an overdose of propofol and anti-anxiety pills.

Genres of Michael Jackson's music
- Pop

- Rhythm and Blues

- Soul

- Motown

- techno

- new jack swing

- funk

- rock

In particular, one of Michael Jackson's most successful albums, ""Thriller"" explores numerous different genres. The album contains aggressive dance songs and rock tracks such as ""Beat it"". Another hit from the album ""Billie Jean"" has notable funk influences. In contrast the ballads on albums such as ""Human Nature"" were softer and more soulful."
,Michael Jackson sang Pop music and that is why they call him the King of Pop .

,"If u have tried all that without success, try speaking with for physcian."
,"Individuals should consult with their physician before adopting any exercise or diet regimen.
To lose weight, some have tried these tips:
1. Be aware of the calories in what you are eating and drinking. Note: Drinks can be a major source of calories, especially sweetened juices. Alcoholic drinks are also high in calories. And beware of those widely advertised soft drinks. Check the calorie count on the label. You might be shocked.
2. Avoid temptation. If chips, chocolates, or cookies are on hand, you will inevitably eat them! Replace them with low-calorie snacks, such as apples, carrots, whole-grain wafers.
3. Have a snack or an appetizer before eating a meal. It will take the edge off your appetite and may induce you to eat less.
4. Don’t eat everything put in front of you. Be selective. Reject what you know will give you too many calories.
5. Slow down. Why hurry? Enjoy your meal by noticing what you are eating—the colors, the flavors, the interaction of foods. Listen to the body’s signals that say, “I’m full. I don’t need any more.”
6. Stop eating before you feel full.
7. Restaurants in some countries are notorious for serving excessive portions. Leave half of your entrée behind, or share the plate with someone else.
8. Desserts are not essential to complete a meal. It is better to finish off with fruit or another low-calorie item.
9. Food manufacturers want you to eat more. Profit is their bottom line. They will try to exploit your weaknesses. Don’t be taken in by their clever advertising and pretty pictures. You can say no!"

Are you aware of the disaster relief tents?,"In
case the appropriate tools and equipment needed to rescue people are
not available, the risks and death tolls associated with a natural
disaster grow exponentially. Water, medical facilities, food and
shelter are some of the basic needs that need to be provided after a
man made or natural disaster.One of the ways through which fast
shelter can be set up is through use of disaster
relief tents.
This is the latest innovation that is making it easy for people to
cope with different types of disasters.Ideally, these are lightweight
in nature and as such, they can be easily carried to distant places
without facing much difficulty. They can be folded up easily as well
and set up within the shortest timeline. In order to set up disaster
relief tents, you don't need any special equipment or extra pair of
hands. Another way through which these tents can be of great use is
when they are used to house volunteers. People who are doing
volunteer work to save disaster victims can be housed in these tents
as they carry on with the rescue operations. These tents can also be
used to set up equipment that aids with tracing the weather and other
technologically advanced tool for scoping the area and establishing
whether there are other people trapped or lost in the locality. It
is important to buy tents from a reputed brand."

Why do some people think you'll go to hell just for being gay? Like can't you have an opinion over who you want to love??,"You ask:  Like can't you have an opinion over who you want to love??
So, you imply being gay is a choice you can make---do you believe that?"
,"people misinterpret the bible, thinking that being gay is a sin. Also, people (christians) throw their beliefs on others and it sucks. I personally have experienced hate while i was at a private christian school because i was gay. The only thing making people believe that your sexual orientation is a sin is beliefs and ignorance."
,Some would say that being gay is a demon that can be cast out.
,"Because they pick and choose what Bible verses to believe .. And the Old Testament in Leviticus says that homosexuality is a sin deserving death. 
Of course, it also says not to eat certain things or wear clothing made of multiple materials ... Which they conveniently ignore."
,B cuz the Bible says in 1st Chorinthians 6:9 that homosexuals will not enter the kingdom of God
,Your sexual orientation has nothing to do with hell or heaven because both don't exist. You live right and do whatever makes you happy without hurting other. Hell or heaven created by you with the kind of living you do.
,"If you are referring to one of the three monothestic religions the reason it was frowned on was because homosexuality was often seen in temple prostitution to other gods such as Ishtar. It is the homosexual act that is ""taboo""often translated as an abomination in the bible.
It is also noted that when man and woman join in love they become one flesh.
In Genesis 2:22 Woman was made from man's rib/side. In Jewish Midrash Adam or Adama was both male and female androgenous.
The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken from the man, and brought her to the man. The man said, ""This is now bone of my bones, And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man."" For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.

http://thetorah.com/the-making-of-adam/
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse_of_Adam
Genesis 2:24
Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: And they shall be one flesh.
Mark 10:8
And they twain shall be one flesh: So then they are no more twain, but one flesh.
Cor 6:16
Or do you not know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body with her? For He says, ""THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH.""
Eph 5:28 - 29
So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself; for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church,
Even in tantric sex the union must be between man and woman which is eastern belief."
,"Opinions seem to communicate Choice. Can you choose who you fall in love with? When did I choose to be heterosexual . . .
That being said, Most holy Scriptures have a problem with Same sex relationships. It was either misunderstood be the original writers, or Simply meant that the union would not produce fresh off-spring to Indoctrinate and keep the religion moving forward.
No Gods are required for men to produce texts to control the masses by fear of an invisible eternal punishment.
Lucky for them I guess . . . Becaue no Gods could be found."
,"Q ""Why do some people think you'll go to hell just for being gay? Like can't you have an opinion over who you want to love??""
Let's start with what you have boiled it down to: ""can't you have an opinion over who you want to love??""
If, say, it's just a handful of you on an Island by yourselves where no rules apply [extremely impractical, of course] then perhaps you cannot only have an opinion over who you want to love, be it your neighbour's wife, daughter or son, [or even all three] or what you want to smoke or snort but you can go ahead and act on that opinion.
However, if you want to organise yourselves into a smoothly functioning society then you will need rules or laws for the wellbeing and future of your society. Even in the most liberal of societies you will have limits beyond which you cannot put your opinions into practice. In the more conservative ones you might be taken to task for just expressing certain opinions, let alone acting upon them.
If a society enacts a certain law it will stipulate what it considers appropriate punishment for any breach of the law. Where a law accepted by a society comes from, or is claimed to come from, an external source [federal, international or ""God""] then that source will most likely have stipulated what it considers appropriate punishment for any breach of the law [be it imprisonment, lashes, stoning or a spell in hell, or any combination thereof]."
,"I'm a Catholic, but I have to say that I don't believe in a lot of things that the Church teaches.
First, I believe that an individual's relationship with God is between that person and God, and nobody else.  This is why I do not believe in confession.  First of all, God will know what sins I have committed, and he will know if I am repentant.  What reason is there to go and confess your transgressions to another human being?
As far as going to Hell when you die, I believe that only people who are evil and have committed evil deeds while they were alive wind up going to Hell.
Even if you never went to a mass in your entire life, but you are a good person with a kind heart, then you are going to go to Heaven.
Being gay certainly does NOT make you evil.  You are allowed to love who you want to love.  If that happens to be another man or another woman, or both, so be it.
I firmly believe that what determines where you go in the afterlife depends fully on how you treated other living things when you were on Earth.

Why do some people think you'll go to hell just for being gay? Like can't you have an opinion over who you want to love??,"You ask:  Like can't you have an opinion over who you want to love??
So, you imply being gay is a choice you can make---do you believe that?"
,"people misinterpret the bible, thinking that being gay is a sin. Also, people (christians) throw their beliefs on others and it sucks. I personally have experienced hate while i was at a private christian school because i was gay. The only thing making people believe that your sexual orientation is a sin is beliefs and ignorance."
,Some would say that being gay is a demon that can be cast out.
,"Because they pick and choose what Bible verses to believe .. And the Old Testament in Leviticus says that homosexuality is a sin deserving death. 
Of course, it also says not to eat certain things or wear clothing made of multiple materials ... Which they conveniently ignore."
,B cuz the Bible says in 1st Chorinthians 6:9 that homosexuals will not enter the kingdom of God
,Your sexual orientation has nothing to do with hell or heaven because both don't exist. You live right and do whatever makes you happy without hurting other. Hell or heaven created by you with the kind of living you do.
,"If you are referring to one of the three monothestic religions the reason it was frowned on was because homosexuality was often seen in temple prostitution to other gods such as Ishtar. It is the homosexual act that is ""taboo""often translated as an abomination in the bible.
It is also noted that when man and woman join in love they become one flesh.
In Genesis 2:22 Woman was made from man's rib/side. In Jewish Midrash Adam or Adama was both male and female androgenous.
The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken from the man, and brought her to the man. The man said, ""This is now bone of my bones, And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man."" For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.

http://thetorah.com/the-making-of-adam/
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse_of_Adam
Genesis 2:24
Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: And they shall be one flesh.
Mark 10:8
And they twain shall be one flesh: So then they are no more twain, but one flesh.
Cor 6:16
Or do you not know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body with her? For He says, ""THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH.""
Eph 5:28 - 29
So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself; for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church,
Even in tantric sex the union must be between man and woman which is eastern belief."
,"Opinions seem to communicate Choice. Can you choose who you fall in love with? When did I choose to be heterosexual . . .
That being said, Most holy Scriptures have a problem with Same sex relationships. It was either misunderstood be the original writers, or Simply meant that the union would not produce fresh off-spring to Indoctrinate and keep the religion moving forward.
No Gods are required for men to produce texts to control the masses by fear of an invisible eternal punishment.
Lucky for them I guess . . . Becaue no Gods could be found."
,"Q ""Why do some people think you'll go to hell just for being gay? Like can't you have an opinion over who you want to love??""
Let's start with what you have boiled it down to: ""can't you have an opinion over who you want to love??""
If, say, it's just a handful of you on an Island by yourselves where no rules apply [extremely impractical, of course] then perhaps you cannot only have an opinion over who you want to love, be it your neighbour's wife, daughter or son, [or even all three] or what you want to smoke or snort but you can go ahead and act on that opinion.
However, if you want to organise yourselves into a smoothly functioning society then you will need rules or laws for the wellbeing and future of your society. Even in the most liberal of societies you will have limits beyond which you cannot put your opinions into practice. In the more conservative ones you might be taken to task for just expressing certain opinions, let alone acting upon them.
If a society enacts a certain law it will stipulate what it considers appropriate punishment for any breach of the law. Where a law accepted by a society comes from, or is claimed to come from, an external source [federal, international or ""God""] then that source will most likely have stipulated what it considers appropriate punishment for any breach of the law [be it imprisonment, lashes, stoning or a spell in hell, or any combination thereof]."
,"I'm a Catholic, but I have to say that I don't believe in a lot of things that the Church teaches.
First, I believe that an individual's relationship with God is between that person and God, and nobody else.  This is why I do not believe in confession.  First of all, God will know what sins I have committed, and he will know if I am repentant.  What reason is there to go and confess your transgressions to another human being?
As far as going to Hell when you die, I believe that only people who are evil and have committed evil deeds while they were alive wind up going to Hell.
Even if you never went to a mass in your entire life, but you are a good person with a kind heart, then you are going to go to Heaven.
Being gay certainly does NOT make you evil.  You are allowed to love who you want to love.  If that happens to be another man or another woman, or both, so be it.
I firmly believe that what determines where you go in the afterlife depends fully on how you treated other living things when you were on Earth. 
If you were malicious and you constantly hurt others and aimed to destroy the happiness of others, then you will reap what you sow."
"If there were only three original languages; Hebrew, Latin, and Greek, where does the name Jesus come from? None of these languages had a J in their alphabet.","Jesus"" is an Anglicized form of the Greek name Yesous found in the New Testament. Yesous represents the Hebrew Bible name Yeshua, which occurs as ""Jeshua"" in English Bibles (Ezra 2:2; Neh 7:7).
In Medieval English the ""J"" was pronounced as a ""Y."" ""Yehoshua""Yeshua, in turn, is a shortened form of the name Yehoshua (""Joshua"" in English Bibles).
Moses' right-hand man, Joshua, has three names in the Bible. Originally, it was Hoshea, but Moses changed it to Yehoshua (Num 13:16). During the Babylonian Exile, it was shorted to Yeshua (Neh 8:17

,"Ancient Latin alphabet
The earliest known inscriptions in the Latin alphabet date from the 6th century BC. It was adapted from the Etruscan alphabet during the 7th century BC. The letters Y and Z were taken from the Greek alphabet to write Greek loan words. Other letters were added from time to time as the Latin alphabet was adapted for other languages."
,"Q ""If there were only three original languages; Hebrew, Latin, and Greek, where does the name Jesus come from? None of these languages had a J in their alphabet.""
As was done to the ""Father"" whose name Yhwh was corrupted to Jehovah so was done to the ""Son"" whose name Yeshoo3ah [the 3 indicates that the 'a' vowel is a guttural sound]  has been corrupted to Jesus.
Just like the ""Son"" cannot be blamed for not turning his head if called upon by the corrupted name that he was never called by at any point in his time on earth and which bears no resemblance to the name he was given, similarly the ""Father"" might not respond to those who cannot be bothered to call him by the name they see in their scriptures.
While on the topic of the real name of the ""Son"" it is intriguing to note that in
OT prophecies that are said to apply to ""Jesus"", in Isaiah  for example, he is not
mentioned by name, neither is he referred to by his title Messiah or Anointed,
However, in Psalm 20:6 we read of God saving His Messiah. The verse says, “Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven
with the saving strength of his right hand.”
The root of the word Yeshoo3ah has to do with the verb save. The elongated oo vowel in the middle suggests a passive form. Thus Yeshoo3ah means one who was saved. It does not mean one who saved which is Yashaa3ah. So Yeshoo3ah means saved not saviour, This makes it consistent with the prophecy in Psalm 20:6 as quoted above."

What Are The Career Options After Plus Two Science Than Medicine And Engineering?,"Apart from medicine and engineering, there are a number of alternative career options that you could consider moving into in the future instead. These could include, but are not limited to:

• Nursing
• Zoology
• Biochemistry
• Biotechnology
• Dentistry
• Pharmacy
• Occupational therapy

Having taken Plus Two Science, it could also be possible to change towards a completely non-science related course at degree level. People who have taken Plus Two Science have moved on to take degrees in a number of diverse areas that are not strictly related to the content of the science course that they had previously studied. Courses that Plus Two Science students have gone on to studies include areas such as commerce, banking, management, languages, media and teaching.

Taking a strong academic course like Plus Two science should mean that your career options remain fairly open after you have completed the course. Although medicine and engineering are the two most obvious, common and popular career options, they are by no means the only career routes that are available to you. You should not feel pressurized into pursuing medicine or engineering if it is not a career you will enjoy. You are still in a strong position to pursue whatever career option appeals to you - you have time on your side in your career ahead of you.

Most schools and colleges have specialist career advisers who can help guide you towards a career option that interests you. Failing that, there are plenty of books that can provide you with useful tips. Entering a phrase like 'career options', 'career guidance' or 'job ideas' should provide you with a wealth of resources and websites that may give you inspiration to help give you ideas for the future."
,"Hello,
Thanks for Asking..!!
Deciding career after 12th is really hard. Many students get confused which field is better & have good career opportunities, job securities.
But it should be decided very carefully. Because the future depends on this decision.
Well,  the students who take Science subject, their main target is to become Engineer or Doctor.
But Except Engineering & Doctor, there are many other professions available.
B.Sc. + M.Sc. Will also help you to get a successful career.

The Best option which comes in my mind after Engineering & Medical is Research career.

If Science is the subject of your interest & you want to get good job opportunities & Reputed work, then go for Research field.

For this you have to prepare for CSIR NET Exam. Which is the national eligibility test, conducted for science students who are  willing to pursue your career further as a Junior Research Fellow or an Assistant Professor.

You can also go for Management Courses like - BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration), BHM (Bachelor of Hotel Management), BMS (Bachelor of Management Studies) etc.

As we all know that management courses are in very demand. So you can think about it.

B.C.A. - Bachelor of Computer Applications is also a degree course of 3 year duration in which you have to learn about Computers, software and applications, programming languages etc.

After completing BCA/ MCA , you can get a job in private as well as Government sectors of Software developer, Computer Engineer etc.

B.Arch. - Bachelor of Architecture

It is a 5 year course in which you read about lanning and construction of homes, buildings, commercial structures, public utility structures etc.

You can get a job of Consultant, Planning & Design professional, Chief Architect etc.

Other career options are -

B.Pharmacy. , B.B.A., Navy courses , Diploma courses (Biotechnology, Jewellery Designing, Interior Designing, Event Management etc)
I hope it will help you.
Best of Luck :)"

How To Cash A Income Tax Check Without An Id?,
What is Tinder desktop?,"Tinder Desktop is a version of Tinder which is designed to be used on a PC, or laptop, as the original was exclusively a mobile app.
There seems to be a lot of hype surrounding Tinder, and no doubt Tinder Desktop will only increase the buzz. To me, Tinder is perhaps the most soulless of dating apps, but it doesn't pretend to be much else, so I've got to give it some credit.
Users are presented with very little information about their suitors, usually just a name picture, and age before they say yay or nay. I've never had the joy of using Tinder myself, but it seems fairly obvious that Tinder is unlikely to help you find a meaningful relationship.
Tinder Desktop offers no variation from the original app. But, if you want easy access to a list of possible hook-ups, which you can browse when you should be hard at work, or if you think you’re in need of another social media platform that you can endlessly refresh, then maybe Tinder Desktop is for you.
However, using Tinder Desktop isn't without its risks. You should be careful about what information you divulge to your new 'friends', and always be extra cautious when meeting strangers."
,"Tinder Desktop is a version of the Tinder app which runs on PC's operated by Windows.
In order to have it fully functioning you must go through a few simple steps, namely:
1 - You need to first download Andy Android emulator software to your computer. It is available for free on the official website (http://www.andyroid.net/). 
It’s trusted software and used by millions of users, therefore pretty safe.
2 - Then you need to click on the installer file you downloaded and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.
3 - Once the software starts running, it will ask you a few simple questions which will complete the setup and you will end up seeing an Android tablet like user interface.
4 -You will then see the Google Play store app within Andy (just like on any Android device). Launch that app.
5 - Using the Google Play search tool, search for ""Tinder app"".
6 - Finally click on the “Install” option to begin the automatic installation of this app on your computer.

How do you hack Instagram to view private photos?,"Frankly, you DON'T hack an Instagram account to view private photos. 
They're private for a reason. I think you need to really look at your motives for hacking and seeking to look at prohibited images. What is your reason?

Nosiness?
Is it just simple curiosity that makes you want to do this? If you're interested in other people's lives, you should maybe start reading autobiographies,, which are written by people who want to share the details of their lives with complete strangers.
Sexual gratification?
Do you want to look for pictures  that will turn you on? How did it come to this? If this is you motivation, you need to learn something about consent and objectification. The people in those photos have not consented to you objectification of them.
Jealously?
Are you looking for evidence of a betrayal or proof that someone you once loved no longer loves you? Be kind to yourself and don't go rooting through data that does not belong to you."

How Do I Retrieve A Deleted Comment On My Wall On Facebook?,"As of yet there is no way to retrieve a deleted comment on your Facebook wall, however you may still be able to read them if you have it enabled so that you are notified when a comment is placed on your wall, or photo or anything of yours on Facebook. To do this all you will have to do is check your emails for the email from Facebook notifying you of the comment. If you do not have this enabled then it can be done through the account setting tab under notifications.

Facebook is a social networking service and website launched in February 2004, operated and privately owned by Facebook, Inc. As of January 2011, Facebook has more than 600 million active users. Users may create a personal profile, add other users as friends, and exchange messages, including automatic notifications when they update their profile. Facebook users must register before using the site. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups, organized by workplace, school or college, or other characteristics. The name of the service stems from the colloquial name for the book given to students at the start of the academic year by university administrations in the United States to help students get to know each other better. Facebook allows any users who declare themselves to be at least 13 years old to become registered users of the website.

Facebook was founded by Mark Zuckerberg with his college roommates and fellow computer science students Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes. The website's membership was initially limited by the founders to Harvard students, but was expanded to other colleges in the Boston area, the Ivy League, and Stanford University. It gradually added support for students at various other universities before opening to high school students, and, finally, to anyone aged 13 and over, but based on ConsumersReports.org on May 2011, there are 7.5 million children under 13 with accounts, violating the site's terms. The story of Facebook has recently been made into a movie entitled ‘The Social Network’ which tells the story of Facebook’s invention and the legal battles that followed."

What Are The Advantages An Disadvantages Of Operating Systems?,"An operating system, or OS, is a software program that enables the computer hardware to communicate and operate with the computer software. The most well-known operating systems are Windows, Mac OS and Linux, all of which have different versions. Although Windows is a PC-based OS, it can be run on a Mac computer with the help of a programme called Parallels, for example. Generally speaking, here is a brief summary of pros and cons of each major operating system:

Windows:
- Can be expensive, especially compared to Linux, which is in most cases free.
- Easy to use, especially for new computer users, and plenty of help resources are available online.
- Although Microsoft Windows has made great improvements in reliability with recent versions, it still lags behind its competitors.
- It has a large library of available software, games and utilities, although many are expensive.
- Hardware manufacturers all make drivers and support for Windows OS.
- Openness to virus attacks is a major disadvantage.

Linux:
- It is an open source OS, which in most cases is free.
- Inexperienced computer users may find it more difficult to get to grips with Linux.
- It is very reliable and rarely freezes.
- Fewer computer programs, games and utilities are available for Linux.
- Many programs are free or open source, even very complex ones.
- There are still some manufacturers that do not offer hardware support for Linux OS, although there are fewer every year.
- The open source nature of Linux allows more advanced users to customise the code as they wish.
- Fewer people use Linux, therefore it is more difficult to find someone fully familiar with it, although there are vast resources online.

Mac OS:
- MAC computers are more expensive generally than PCs.
- MAC is a much more secure OS, and is far less open to viruses and malware.
- Stability is a major advantage - it very rarely crashes, loses data or freezes.
- Fewer computer programs and games are available for MACs.
- As most computer components of MACs are made by Apple, there are not many driver issues, unlike with PCs, which are made by many different manufacturers
MAC OS is not as customisable as Windows or Linux."
,"Advantages:
1.easy to use
2.user friendly
3.intermediate between all hardwares and softwares of the system
4.no need to know any technical languages
5.Its the platform of all programs

disadvantages:

1.if any problems affected in OS, you may lose all the contents which have been stored already
2.unwanted user can use your own system"
,"Well every personal computer or business computer, has an operating system. Such as Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows 2000, Mac OS tiger, Mac OS leopard, Linux. Etc.

This is where you come to choose, you should check what software or hardware that is available to be used on the specific OS. Not all software works on ever OS!!! So you might have to do some research on what is the most compatible for you. Because this can save you a lot of money!

Hopefully this was helpful!
Any other questions, msg me!

,"Windows have a very high compatability with games, and basically everything is on windows!
MAC's are expensive and non customisable, for example you can't upgrade the componants inside very easily and a lot of game are not compatible!! Only good thing really is the custom voices in the terminal and virus protection."

,advantages of operating also disadvantages of operating system
,"Tha advantages of OS is speed, compatibility, safety and security, user interface. Tha major disadvantages are virus and malware."
,"Tha advantages of operating systems are, compatibility, user interface, speed, piracy. Disadvantages are virus, malware, resource hog."
,"The advantages of the operating system are, compatibility, speed, user interface, piracy. The main disadvantages are virus, malware, and resource hog."
,"There are no disadvantages to an operating system, being that without an operating system, a computer would not be able to function, at least where it would be any more than a series of static pictures.

Think of the operating system as you would think of the traffic lights in a major city, say, New York, for example.  Just as the traffic lights regulate the traffic in the city, the operating system regulates the traffic in the computer.  And not only that, it also serves as the liaison between the programs you may have installed and the computer.  Think of it somewhat like an attendant at an airport terminal.  You can see the planes out on the tarmac, you can see flights landing and leaving, however, how would you know which plane is which, if you do not have someone to guide you.  And that is the attendant, or one could say the liaison that acts as a go between the planes and the passengers.  Basically, an operating systems nothing more than a liaison between the hardware and the software, and of course much, much more.  Look up Operating Systems on the Internet, there's a wealth of knowledge to be had for free.  What I have mentioned is simply scratching the surface."

What is your favorite song of 2017?,I'm going with a country western this time .... I love the lyrics.
,Wo men ai qing de gu shi ~ :D
,"Hey there! This is a hard question to be honest. So many
artists produced amazing albums and singles. Right now I think it might be
Kendrick Lamar’s Humble. I am not a big fan of the rapper, but the lyrics of this
song just blew my mind the first time I heard it. I have been listening to the
single at least once a day ever since it was released."
,Hi! It will have to be Despacito by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee! The song is popular all over the world and most youngsters know the lyrics by heart even if it’s all in Spanish. I also enjoy the remixed version; it features Justin Bieber and it holds some English bits that make it even better!
,How Far I'll Go
,"One of my favorite song of 2017 is Luis Fonsi song ""Despacito"". He is a prominent Puerto Rican singer and songwriter who is known best for his worldwide hit song Despacito. Luis Fonsi Despacito featuring Daddy Yankee has charted at number one in US Latin."

Would you stop smoking to prevent cardiovascular disease?,"I didn't start ... Because it's a stinking, filthy habit."
,I puff on cigars i dont inhale amd im not quiting
,"I don't smoke, but I know too many people who do or did. The risk of cardiovascular disease is real. My dad smoked for over 50 years. He had a heart attack that he wouldn't have survived if there wasn't a paramedic standing next to him at the time. Both my grandfathers died from heart disease, and they both smoked. My sister-in-law's brother refused to quit. He has had several heart attacks and a stroke. He looks like a walking skeleton. He has tried to quit, and has several times, but it never seems to stick. For some the addiction is too hard to kick."
,i never smoked.
,"Hello there. This is the question I asked myself a few years
ago after the death of an uncle who suffered from a heart disease. The decision
was not hard to take at all as it was either shortening my days on Earth or
living healthily without smoking. Right now, it has been five years since I
stopped inhaling tobacco, and I do not regret the decision at all."
,"Yes..!
smoking can increase the risk of heart disease.
It affects the vessels that supply blood to your heart and other parts of your body. It also reduces the amount of oxygen in your blood and damages blood vessel walls severely.
Smokers not only have more heart attacks, strokes, and angina than non-smokers but also at a much younger age.
Smoking not only affects the heart it also affects your health and leads to cancer & other health problems. So, for a healthy body, you should stop smoking."

Just be sure to thank him for his time and mention that you want to do well (what you said here) after you are done. I don't see how a teacher can be mad after a student genuinely thanks him!"
,"Having a record of the conversation, its less chance of a misunderstanding. Teachers can't b too careful these days."

him questions about a topic that you have not understood, then no, you are not

I am 17 years old and I study high-school . I like to go to the movies, buy clothes and go out to eat. I played American football, not anymore. I have an average of 86, without making much effort.

I speak with many, but I am the one who initiates the conversation, they rarely write to me or call me. I've never had a girlfriend, just a few dates. I would like to go out more, but my colleagues hardly invite me. My classmates make fun of me and it affects me a lot. They never tell me the reason. Sometimes I play videogames. And I read a lot.

You can find then if you want to. Even nerds have friends."
,"Absolutely nothing you described sounds strange. Sounds really average, actually, just like every other guy I know at my school.
Maybe you need to get away from those people (bullies) in particular. Ive been in a few classes where it was amazingly just full of bullies, and everyone else fits in by singling out a person. But I would switch into another classroom, and it would be full of positive people who aren't too stuck up to include even the weirdest quiet dude in the corner.
From the info given, I say you probably don't need to change anything about yourself.
Don't ask the bullies ""why"" they're bullying you. Most of the time, they bully someone ""just because"". That's high school for you.
Try to stay confident and just trust that in 2 years later, your whole situation will be brand new and you'll foret about these people. Think back 2 years, what do you remember?"

,I love popcorn and life has been good.  :)

Is there a way to recover deleted photos on my phone? (Details below...),"While she is correct that it is illegal for you to have access to another patient's information without their consent ... The instant they hooked your father up to that IV, it became part of his medical record.  So if you have permission to access his medical information, you have every right to take the picture and keep it.

I would also suggest you immediately contact the hospital's ""Quality Control"" department or ""Administration"", and ask them what they are going to do about your dad being given someone else's IV.
As to recovering the photo ... It depends on your phone and carrier.  I would suggest contacting them.  But if you don't automatically upload your photos, they're probably deleted for good."
,So I am at the hospital with my dad. I look up at his IV and see a label with a birthday that wasn't my dad's. THE LABELS WERE FOR ANOTHER PATIENT ON MY DADS MEDICATION BAGS WHICH ONE BAG ALREADY WENT INTO HIM LAST NIGHT! So I immediately call for the nurse to explain to me WHY someone else's labels are on my dad's medicine! While waiting I took pictures with my camera. Then took pictures with my phone camera just in case. The nurse freaked out and saw me holding my phone and asked me if I took pictures. I said yah but they weren't very good. She told me I had to delete them because it had someone else's patient info on them. I asked well can you show me that this medication IS suppose to be my dads?!!? She said she would show me as soon as I deleted them. So I did. The medication was ordered for him. Now Yinny here is photo obsessed and she had no clue I took pictures first on my regular camera which I WILL NOT delete. But in my opinion the pictures on my phone were a tad bit better lighting.

Treat your pet

Let your dog sleep with you tonight.  Check your sheets tomorrow for actual detritus or fleas themselves.  Monitor yourself during the day to see if you itch more than usual.

What is the best App for job seekers?,its called setting down the phone and getting out there to look with your eyes.  People are so reliant on technology that's is become a nuisance.  If you want to show someone you want a job you go to them and inquire about it. It shows initiative.
,"I don't think any app like that exists. Ofcourse, there's websites for job listings, but not an app.
Indeed and SimplyHired are both websites that provide job openings for job seekers.
SimplyHired allows you to find jobs near your area by entering your city and state that you live in as well as the job title that you're looking for. It also has a count at the top saying ""x new jobs since your last visit"", where ""x"" is a number.
Indeed is pretty much a replica for SimplyHired, just re-formatted. So you can use either website and you'll get pretty relevant job search results.
Keep in mind, though, it's not so easy that all you have to do is apply online and you get the job. No, most employers will ask to schedule an appointment for an interview and ask that you bring a resume and cover letter.
I wish you the best of luck in your job hunt!"
,"Go to Google Play, there are lots of apps for job seekers. I used Monster job search app. Good luck for your job search"
,"It depends whereabouts you are geographically as to which apps I'd recommend as the best for job hunting, but rest assured there are plenty around, so wherever you are, you should be able to access all the information you need on the go.
One app I'd recommend downloading no matter where you are is LinkedIn Jobs.
LinkedIn is the largest social network for ""professionals and recruiters"", so it makes sense to use their app if you're looking for a job. you can find it here:
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/linkedin-job-search/id886051313?mt=8
One of the best features is the ""Apply in App"" option. If you have a LinkedIn profile that offers enough details about you to potential employers, then applying for jobs can be as simple as tapping a button, rather than filling out complicated forms and uploading documents.
Other apps that will help you find a job (based on your location)
USA. Indeed is the biggest job database in the States, and is again available on both Android and iPhone. The great thing about Indeed is the ability to be able to apply for jobs straight from your phone. It's really intuitive and easy to use, and is handy if you're on the run but still want to be productive.
UK. Monster is available for Android and iPhone, and has one of the largest selection of job adverts in the country. You can also upload your CV through the website and employers have the opportunity to contact you directly if they like the look of your skillset.
If you're in a different country, I apologise! But if you search through your phone's app store I'm sure you'll have an equivalent for your country. If all else fails, head to your local job centre and they should be able to point you in the direction of the best resources."

According to reviews you will see results after two weeks or so, but after several months of consistent use, you should have an even brighter skin tone.
We have not tested this ourselves however, we would recommend using natural remedies and concentrate on accepting yourself for who you are, including your skin colour.  We all have something about ourselves that we could change if we had the option.  For many people, being able to make these changes, say having plastic surgery or losing a lot of eight doesn't solve the underlying issues of low self esteem that will still need to be dealt with.

If this is the case, you might want to look into a microdermabrasion treatment, which is essentially day by day resurfacing of the skin on your face.  This should be done with supervision, and beware of cheap products with no instructions!

,"There is nothing wrong if you want to look fairer and more attractive; everybody does. But every time you buy a skin lightening cream, understand the extent of what it can do for your skin as well as the limitations. Pick the best in the market after due research."
How To Get A Fair Skin For Men?,"If you have a dark appearance and have the desire to make your skin fairer, there are a variety of things you can explore. Dark skin is sometimes a sign of too much melanin in the skin - but if you wish to make your skin tone lighter, you can blend together a mixture of rosewater and sandalwood. This will cool your skin thanks to its relieving properties, leaving it feeling refreshed.
You will be left with a lighter glow due to the fresh properties that sandalwood contains. Other alternatives in the pursuit of lighter skin include making paste of rose water and almonds. You should apply this in a delicate manner to the face on a nightly basis and onto the neck area to encourage a lighter appearance.
It is also true that vegetables have the ability to encourage lighter skin. You can use things like cucumbers and the skins of grapes that can be easily applied to the eyes or neck area as well as tomatoes, which you can gently rub on your face as some are acidic and will remove the dead skills to help you exfoliate. You can even use potatoes - these should be soaked in water for at least ten minutes before gently scrubbing the face.
Almond paste and ground almonds will be able to do similar jobs to the vegetable preparation, and you can also add in a teaspoon of milk and some lime juice to create a thin gloopy paste that you should gently massage into the skin.

In terms of ""becoming fair"" you may be talking about your skin or your hair. Changing your skin colour is becoming more and more common; however it can lead to permanent damage and is often quite dangerous. You must seek professional and regulated products if this is something you decide to go through with. Changing your hair colour is obviously far easier and much safer, but also carries some risk if not done properly.
Changing your skin colour
If this is something you decide to go through with then you must research the best method for you. This could be a home remedy or by using bleaching creams that have a chemical called hydroquinone added to them. These are available in the pharmacy and they work by decreasing melanin production. Melanin is the pigment in your skin which determines the colour of your skin.  However these creams will not have the desired effect in 2 days, but it will take a week to 10 days to start to work.
Lightening your hair
Depending on what your original hair colour is, becoming fair could take 15 minutes or several weeks to get to the shade you desire. If you visit a hairdresser and ask them to go from dark brown or black hair to fair they may advise you to take this in a few steps as the chemicals used to bleach your hair can be very damaging. Generally hairdressers use peroxide to bleach hair, which is a very harsh chemical and can often cause allergic reactions, so always have this done by a professional.
The colour of a person's skin is not primarily due to outside factors although it can be partially influenced by them. A person's skin is a certain colour due to melanin, which is also known as pigment. It is a substance that affects the colour of a person's skin. Melanin absorbs or disperses ultra-violet light. Some theorists believe there is a correlation between dark skin and a substance called folate that is found in all people. In various studies it has been seen that ultra-violet light has a detrimental effect on folate levels. One test showed that when the substance was placed under a source of ultra-violet light the folate levels were reduced by half in just an hour. Folate is a member of the vitamin B family. This vitamin is used in the growth of the body. It is theorised that people with black skin have a high melanin count, which protects the folate in the body from being damaged by ultra-violet light.
     On the other hand some studies have been carried out showing the effect of ultra-violet light on the growth of vitamin D. It has been shown that UV rays promote the growth of vitamin D. A lot of people who have white skin are shown to have lived in the top of the northern hemisphere where UV light is weaker and therefore they produce less vitamin D. Due to this, it is thought that people developed less melanin in these areas so that their bodies would allow more of the UV rays in to grow the vitamin D. When we understand why are skin is a certain colour we can understand that it is not something that can be drastically changed in an easy way but has developed over countless generations to be the way it is now."

How Do You Get Rid Of Acne Scars On Your Nose?,"Acne is the most common skin problem, affecting an estimated 80% of people between the ages of 11 and 30 at one time or another - so you are not alone! Also, many celebrities are among those affected, such as Cameron Diaz, Victoria Beckham and the late Richard Burton, so this only goes to show that acne doesn't have to be a barrier to being considered very attractive.
Make-up can make a tremendous difference to the appearance of the cysts, scars and pitted effect that can be caused by the more severe types of acne, as these photographs of the lovely Ms Diaz show.
There are a number of companies which make specialist camouflage make-up, which can hide a whole range of facial disfigurements such as birthmarks and port wine stains, as well as acne scars.
These products usually differ from mainstream foundations, in that they are designed to stay on a lot longer, and are thicker and more dense than conventional products.
Of course, for mild to moderate acne, non-specialist make-up, well-applied, may be all that is required to transform your appearance, as this video tutorial shows:
However, for more heavy-duty, longer-lasting effects, some of the best-known manufacturers of specialist make-up are as follows:
Covermark
Dermablend
Dermacolor
Keromask
Veil

The results are amazing, and no-one need ever know that you have acne scars or pitting of the skin at all!"

Do this twice a week, and within a couple of months, you should see a real improvement. It takes a bit of time, but stick with it. You won't be sorry."

Why Do They Call Las Vegas 'Sin City'?,"Las Vegas is called 'Sin City' for many different reasons.

One of the main reasons that they call Las Vegas 'Sin City' is because people commit sins when they are in Las Vegas.

Some people consider gambling to be a sin and since they think gambling is a sin, then Las Vegas would be the sin capital of the world because of all of the gambling opportunities that are available in Las Vegas.

Another reason that people call Las Vegas 'Sin City' is because there are illegal activities that take place there such as prostitution, drug rings, and underage drinking and gambling. All of these activities are considered to be sins to many people.

Therefore, Las Vegas is often referred to as 'Sin City'. As they say, ""What happens in Las Vegas, stays in Las Vegas""."

,"Take to heart Jesus' words in Matthew 6:34. In other words, handle each problem as it arises, and do worry unduly about the future.
Of course, it is not wrong to think about a problem and take practical and suitable steps to solve it, if possible. But, after we have done what we can respecting the matter, worry will achieve nothing more and can never take the place of prayer."

,"I have a worry problem. I also believe in Jesus with all I have.

Ok. Constant worrying can b part of anxiety. It is for me. I'm not trying to say u have anxiety but there is definitley something there. Start with your Dr and see what he/she reccpmends. They r trained for this. They can at least get u started."

,"You more than likely take some things too seriously. Don’t waste your time fussing over things you can’t change.

,"I can't help you. I think it has to do with the environment in which someone is raised. I was taught, and still believe, it is time and energy wasted. You can put it all in worrying what might happen, or you can enjoy what is actually happening. 
Yes, save for your future and for an emergency fund. But other than that, don't do stupid things and enjoy life. No one lays on their deathbed saying they wished they worried more. They do say they wish they did the things they wanted to do more. I am trying not to be one of those people. "

,"If u have tried all that without success, try speaking with for physcian."
,"Individuals should consult with their physician before adopting any exercise or diet regimen.
To lose weight, some have tried these tips:
1. Be aware of the calories in what you are eating and drinking. Note: Drinks can be a major source of calories, especially sweetened juices. Alcoholic drinks are also high in calories. And beware of those widely advertised soft drinks. Check the calorie count on the label. You might be shocked.
2. Avoid temptation. If chips, chocolates, or cookies are on hand, you will inevitably eat them! Replace them with low-calorie snacks, such as apples, carrots, whole-grain wafers.
3. Have a snack or an appetizer before eating a meal. It will take the edge off your appetite and may induce you to eat less.
4. Don’t eat everything put in front of you. Be selective. Reject what you know will give you too many calories.
5. Slow down. Why hurry? Enjoy your meal by noticing what you are eating—the colors, the flavors, the interaction of foods. Listen to the body’s signals that say, “I’m full. I don’t need any more.”
6. Stop eating before you feel full.
7. Restaurants in some countries are notorious for serving excessive portions. Leave half of your entrée behind, or share the plate with someone else.
8. Desserts are not essential to complete a meal. It is better to finish off with fruit or another low-calorie item.
9. Food manufacturers want you to eat more. Profit is their bottom line. They will try to exploit your weaknesses. Don’t be taken in by their clever advertising and pretty pictures. You can say no!"

What Is The Scope Of The Manufacturing Engineering In India?,"The scope of manufacturing engineering in India is quite vast, and it includes manufacturing management of all sorts of products, from simple machines to technical computer parts to any sort of other product. Engineers in this discipline will spend their time ensuring that processes related to designing, producing and packaging products is streamlined, efficient, and logical. Engineers use their skill to do time-motion studies that help them decide how best to manufacture products in a factory, assembly line, or warehouse. Different types of fabrication are featured in manufacturing engineering, and these include mechanics and kinematics, among many others.

Studying manufacturing engineering

Universities and colleges all over the world teach the discipline of manufacturing engineering to their students. These post-secondary educational institutions are also available in India for students who wish to study in Indian languages, and then go on to work in the manufacturing engineering field in their home country. To learn about engineering courses, visit the official websites of universities in that country, and learn all you can about which engineering courses and degree programs are offered. The best engineering students will be practical, with excellent math skills and significant ability to understand machines and mechanical processes. Engineers use math and science to create ideal systems of manufacture, and these skills are taught in four-year university programs.

Job prospects

India has many opportunities for engineers - however, it may not offer as many factories and plants as countries like China or the USA. The global economy is weak at the moment, and lucrative jobs for skilled workers are harder to come by. Nonetheless, there will always be some demand for manufacturing engineers. To gauge the amount of jobs available in India, check job boards or look at job postings at big corporations in the country. Knowing who's hiring and what they're paying can be extremely useful information as you plan your career path."

What Is The Temperature In Cyprus In December?,"It certainly won't be exceedingly hot, but the temperature will peak around 18C which is a mild temperature for December. At the worst, it might fall to about 8C which is of course a spring temperature for the UK."

During December the warm fronts are milder which brings temperatures between 8-18C. Although this is relatively cool for the region, a seasonal holiday is recommended due to the lack of peak-season visitors (making it considerably less crowded).

"My penis' skin is constantly dry and cracked looking, and nothing seems to help. Any suggestions?","All of the body's extremities are susceptible to dry skin, so the fact that it is the skin on your penis that is dry may not be relevant. However, if it is very dry and cracked, then the initial advice must be to consult with your physician. There is no need for embarrassment, as any good doctor will have a lot of experience with such issues. 
I often have dry skin myself, especially around the eyes. I use cucumber cream daily, which keeps this in check, although petroleum jelly enhanced with aloe vera is also very useful. When I shower, I use a gel made by Imperial Leather, made with cotton extract and oat milk.
Showering may be part of the problem - too long in the shower or bath can be bad for the skin, as can swimming in chlorinated water. You may also be cleaning yourself with a soap which is causing an allergic reaction.
Dry skin can also be caused by a lack of vitamins, especially vitamin A. Make sure you get a good supply of vitamin A by eating carrots, eggs, peas, apricots, spinach, pumpkin, oranges, liver or through a multivitamin fruit drink.
You do not specify whether you are sexually active, but if you believe you have contracted this condition through sexual intercourse, then you should visit a sexual health clinic to get tested, and tell the other person involved, as they may need to get checked out as well.
Here's a few more tips on looking after your skin, courtesy of YouTube:"
,"The penis is made of delicate and sensitive skin. The natural oils which the body produces in this area can be easily knocked out of whack causing all sorts of skin ailments. The best way to tackle the issue is to first address the cause.
Soaps and shower gels can dry out or irritate the skin, particularly in the sensitive areas, so perhaps you could try washing the penis with warm water only, or finding a soap designed for sensitive skin. Hot water can also affect the natural balance, washing away the natural oils, and causing the area to become dry and cracked. Try to use only lukewarm water on this area.
Natural coconut oil is a great solution for skin irritations, and can be used on the area as and when you need it. Not only that, but it's great for the body, as it does not contain any chemicals or additives, You can buy natural coconut oil from most supermarkets and health stores, for less the £10.
If the problem persists, you should also visit a doctor to check that there is no underlying issue, as dry or cracked skin on the genitals can be a symptom of a yeast infection or other conditions.
Here is a video which tells you a bit more about the benefits of coconut oil:"

There are three major groups covered by Search Engine Land’s Periodic Table Of SEO Success Factors:
On-the-page SEO
Off-the-page SEO
Violations
Within each group are subgroups, as each chapter of this SEO guide will explain. These subgroups contain one or more individual SEO factors with a specific weight or importance.
Violations, while a group unto themselves, are displayed under the group and subgroup to which they’re associated.
Those two-letter acronyms you see on the chart above? That’s our play on the periodic table of elements and the letter representations, or symbol, of each element. You may have had to remember that the symbol for gold was Au or that iron was Fe.
In the Periodic Table of SEO, we’ve tried to make it slightly more intuitive. The first letter of each “SEO element” comes from the subgroup that it’s in, and the second letter stands for the individual factor.
SEO factors work in combination
No single SEO factor will guarantee search engine rankings. Having a great HTML title won’t help if a page has low-quality content. Having many links won’t help if they are all low in quality. Having several positive factors can increase the odds of success, while the presence of negative factors can worsen those odds.
On-the-page success factors
On-the-page search ranking factors are those that are almost entirely within the publisher’s own control. What type of content do you publish? Are you providing important HTML clues that help search engines (and users) determine relevancy? How does your site architecture help or hinder search engines?
on page SEO tools for free, https://www.prepostseo.com.
Off-the-page success factors
Off-the-page ranking factors are those that publishers do not directly control. Search engines use these because they learned early on that relying on publisher-controlled signals alone didn’t always yield the best results. For instance, some publishers may try to make themselves seem more relevant than they are in reality.
With billions of web pages to sort through, looking only at “on-the-page” clues isn’t enough. More signals are needed to return the best pages for any particular search.
SEO violations & ranking penalties
Make no mistake — search engines want people to perform SEO because it can help improve their search results. Search engines provide help in the form of guidelines, blog posts, and videos to encourage specific SEO techniques.
However, there are some techniques that search engines deem “spam” or “black hat,” which could result in your pages receiving a ranking penalty, or worse, being banned from the search engines entirely.
Violations are general tactics meant to deceive or manipulate a search engine’s understanding of a site’s true relevancy and authority.
A weighting of search ranking factors
All the factors we show are weighted on a scale of 1 to 3, as shown in the top right corner of each factor, as well as reflected in the hue of that factor. A weighting of 3 is most important and is something you should pay special attention to because it has a bigger impact than other factors.
That doesn’t mean that factors weighted 2 or 1 aren’t important; they are. It’s just that they are of less importance, relatively speaking, in terms of the other factors on the chart. Violations are also weighted, but in negative numbers, with -3 being the worst and potentially most harmful to your SEO success.
The weighting is based on a combination of what search engines have said, surveys of the SEO community and our own expertise and experience in watching the space over time. We don’t expect them to be perfect. Not everyone will agree. Your mileage may vary. But we’re confident it is a useful general guide."

,"Anonymous........What You Can Do
1.    Focus on your strengths
While  its good to be aware of your flaws, you also have much to offer.  Recognizing your assets will give you the confidence you need to break free from a negative self-image and/or negativity from others and overcome loneliness.  Ask yourself what are my strengths?  Think of some talents or positive qualities that you possess.
2.    Don't limit yourself to people of your own age. 
You may find that the warmest and sincere friendships are between people with considerable age differences.  Remember, too that conversation is an interchange, not a monologue.  People appreciate good listeners.  So if you tend to be shy, remember - you don't have to carry the whole conversation.
How important is your education to you?
What is the practical value of  school or an education?
Will you not acquire wisdom, use your thinking ability, gain social skills, use common sense and sound judgement.  It's a big world out there the more you learn about the world around you,  the better equipped you will be to know who you are and what you want.
Do not allow anyone to rob you of the value of a good education.  Especially since no one can give you an education - you have to earn your education.  And to do that you must gain the courage you will need to talk to others, (teachers), ask questions and seek answers. 
Anonymous,  Good teachers are appreciated, you will need courage and wisdom to learn how to maneuver around this big world we live in.  Take advantage of their knowledge, take advantage of their wisdom and above all have courage and faith in yourself."

You say you lost your close friends.  But dropping you like a hot rock is not the way close friends act.  Your ""close friends"" were just a group of people that hang together and with you as long as you don't aggravate any of them.  Apologies don't work with such people---you irritated them and that is sufficient (in their minds) grounds for being excluded.
