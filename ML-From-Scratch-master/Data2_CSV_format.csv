Is it okay to take Tylenol with an herbal medicine like Valerian Root?,"They are NOT good together, I have heard that it's recommended taking an FDA approved medication if you have trouble sleeping or have anxiety. If it's just a sleep issue, maybe Benadryl (diphenhydramine) as a temporary/short-term drug. If you need something for long-term, it's best seeing your physician for a prescription medication (possibly Zolpidem or Ambien), which can be used for anxiety/sleep."
I have period related problems.... Please help me out?,"Hi there - It's a little difficult to know where to begin as you have just said you have a ‘period’ related problems.  Without knowing the specifics of your question I’ll try and cover the main type of problems girls/women experience with their periods.
First things first - What is your period?
It’s simply the body’s way - when you are old enough - of getting ready to have a baby. Each month your ovaries produce and release an egg.  If the egg gets fertilized by male sperm - you get pregnant.  If nothing happens, all the nutrients and blood that your body has stored to look after the egg is no longer needed, so your body lets it go - and you get your period. It should happen about every 28 days.
Some women face irregular periods Unless you’re just at puberty or coming up to the menopause when your period can be a bit ‘hit and miss’ - it could be that something else is happening. Things that can make your period irregular are, stress, your weight (putting on too much and losing too much), and doing too much exercise. If you are on contraceptives then they may be causing you a problem also.  A condition known as Polycystic Overy syndrome can cause irregular periods. You should see your doctor about this. There are other things like Thyroid problems which may affect your periods also.
Another very common problem women face is heavy periods - so heavy that they impact daily life. If that’s your problem you should see your doctor. because you can get help. Sometimes you will be offered a contraceptive pill or other drugs that will help. Your doctor may send you for tests to see if you have fibroids - and if you do these can be removed.                                                                     

Pre-Menstrual Syndrome can cause some women a great deal of misery every month - I know because I suffered with this! My mood would swing back and forth and my family would know not to cross me at this time! A friend told me to take Evening Primrose oil and I have to say it helped me.  Other women I know have had to go to their doctor because they symptoms were so severe.
My daughter in law had something called Endometriosis which caused her so many problems with her period- it was very heavy and she had pain and constipation as well! It made her thoroughly miserable and on top of all that she was having problems conceiving. Thankfully she was able to control it with hormone treatment and when it settled down also managed to get pregnant!
Your period should happen regularly, once a month with only a small incoinconvenienceut if it’s more than that I encourage you not to put up with it and go see your doctor to get help-don’t put it off!"
"My Dog Is Leaking Blood From His Penis, What Is Causing This?","Either this is an injury to the penis, or there is a problem with another part of the urinary tract. Second possibility is that there is a bleeding disorder in the body that is only just starting to show.

You must also know that small amounts of blood coming out from the penis are normal from dogs that have not been neutered, but not if this is a regular occurrence. This happens if there are females in heat around them and they are not able to mate with them, and usually this is no more than a few drops.

The most common disease that caused bleeding in un-neutered males is prostrate disease. In this case antibiotics are usually administered. You can also look for signs of an injury to the penis to see if this is the cause."
,"Your dog needs to be examined by a veterinarian.  Bloody discharge from the penis can be from a urinary tract infection, bladder stones, kidney disease/infection, trauma to the prepuce, or infection of the prepuce.  Your veterinarian will examine the prepuce, take a urine sample for urinalysis, and blood work to determine kidney function.  Once the diagnosis is made proper treatment can begin."
,"The bleeding from penis in dogs can be due to injury on penis, infection in urinary tract, infection in prostate and stones in the bladder. If the bleeding is mild and occasional especially when he see female and can not have sex, is normal. But bleeding other than this condition needs to be investigated by Vit."
,"It can be because of a bladder or prostate infection. It can be because of bladder stones & X-ray should be able to show that. If bleeding isn't stopping then kidney or liver function checkup along with platelets & blood cells counts is needed. Bladder or prostate cancer can also be the reason, If there is too much non-stop bleeding."
,"Probably a urinary or track OR Bladder Infection, needs water and Apple Cider Vinegar.  Start with a few drops on his food, increase each day until you reach the following.. (which ever applies to his weight) Up to 14 pounds 1 tsp - Medium dogs 15 - 34 pounds 2 tsp - Large dogs 35 - 84 pounds 1 tablespoon.  The body requires an even balance of good and bad bacteria and PH balance.  Remember lots of water... If blood stops & he is urinating ""less frequently"" keep up with the ACV, Water and Food.  If the symptoms continue, see the vet for care. You can learn a lot more about the benefits of Apple Cider Vinegar at vinegarhealthtips.com ""You'll be amazed!  Good Luck!"
,"Bleeding from the penis is never normal.  It can be related to a urinary tract infection, prostate infection (much more common in intact males), kidney infection, bladder stones, kidney stones, tumors (intact dogs can get transmissible venereal tumors), trauma, or from spontaneous bleeding often from a toxin exposure like certain types of rodenticides.
Have your dog examined by a veterinarian.  Tests may include urinalysis, radiographs, and/or ultrasound."
,If a intact male even smells a bitch in heat his can happen. Possibly a neutered male too but I ma not sure.  He doesn't have to get it on for it to happen. Happens to my male everytime. But if he is peeing blood thats more likely a uti

,"This same thing is happening to my dog. It's like he sheds drops of bright red blood right before he pees, or after. He's been tested for urinary track infection, std, kidney stones, and they're all clear. All his blood tests and xrays are also clear. What can this be? The vets cannot explain this."
,"What is age of your dog? In older dogs, bleeding from the penis is usually due to problems with prostate gland like infection, inflammation, tumors and enlargement. Following are general causes of penile bleeding in dogs.
Stones in kidney/bladder
Trauma

,"A urinary tract infection, bladder stones, kidney stones, and kidney infection are common causes of blood in the urine or from the penis. There could be a injury or infection of the prepuce as well.  Clotting disorders can cause spontaneous bleeding but are not very common.
Have your dog examined by a veterinarian.  The first step would be to have a urinalysis run to rule out infection.  Pending this test bloodwork to assess kidney function, x-rays or ultrasound may be needed to look for stones."
