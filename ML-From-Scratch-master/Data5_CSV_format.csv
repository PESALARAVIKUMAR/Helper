How Many Letter Tiles Are Available In 'Words With Friends'?,"The number of letters that are available in the online word game 'Words with Friends' is:
A = 9
B = 2
C = 2
D = 5
E = 13
F = 2
G = 3
H = 4
I = 8
J = 1
K = 1
L = 4
M = 2
N = 5
O = 8
P = 2
Q = 1
R = 6
S = 5
T = 7
U = 4
V = 2
W = 2
X = 1
Y = 2
Z = 1
* = 2
Words With Friends therefore consists of 104 tiles all in all.

This online scrabble game has millions of Facebook and cell-phone users. It's based upon the traditional scrabble game that is played by forming words from individual letter tiles in either a vertical or horizontal manner.

Each tile comes with a corresponding score which is related to the difficulty in using that letter to form a word. Less frequently used letters such as 'Q' carry more points. The objective of the game is to come up with a word with the highest score. Only words that can be found in a Standard English dictionary may be used.

Words with Friends has more than 173,000 permitted words listed in the Enhanced North American Benchmark Lexicon (ENABLE). ENABLE is popularly used as a reference for many of the other word games online.

The rules of the game are similar to Scrabble itself. The game ends when every tile is used, and there are no tiles remaining. The game could also end if in three successive turns, no score was drawn for each player."
,"You have to remember the blank tiles can be converted, so you can possibly have one more of any of the letters listed."
,"I'm playing Words with friends right now, and there are 6 's' tiles."
,"It says 5 Ds, but I'm looking at a board with 6 played and still 15 letters left.  This is wrong."
,"Don't forget that there are two Blank tiles that can be used in place of any letter you need. The way to check the number of letters on the board is to see if any of them have no score value. When a blank tile is played, there is no value number on it whereas every other tile has a value."

,"When you know how many tiles there are and use scrabble word cheater, you can be undefeatable at the game. And even though I think that cheating isn't a good thing, I do that from time to time just for fun. And have you guys ever cheated playing such games?"
,I am playing a game now and there are six 's' tiles on the board - how come all sources say there are 5 's' tiles?

who invent first video game? and video game name??,"More than fifty
years ago, before either arcades or home video games, visitors waited in
line at Brookhaven National Laboratory to play “Tennis for Two,” an
electronic tennis game that is unquestionably a forerunner of the modern
video game.

Tennis for Two was first introduced on October 18, 1958, at one of
the Lab’s annual visitors’ days. Two people played the electronic tennis
game with separate controllers that connected to an analog computer and
used an oscilloscope for a screen. The game’s creator, William
Higinbotham, was a nuclear physicist lobbied for nuclear
nonproliferation as the first chair of the Federation of American
Scientists."

"My Tinder app is frozen, what do I do?","If your Tinder app freezes half way through using it, that can be pretty annoying.. Especially when you've started a conversation with someone you've matched with.
Anyway, there are a few things you can do if your Tinder app freezes to get it going again. Better still, there's a trick to making sure Tinder doesn't freeze again too.
Method 1 - unfreezing your Tinder app
Double click the home button. This should show you the Tinder app zoomed out. Now swipe up on the window showing the Tinder app. This will shut down the app. Next step is to launch Tinder again, and it should work.
Method 2
Still not working? Try turning your phone off completely, then back on again. Launch the Tinder app. Any luck?
Method 3
If Tinder still keeps freezing, you may want to check that you have the latest version of Tinder. You check if you need an upgrade by opening the app store and selecting the upgrades tab.
Method 4
Now, I really recommend you watch this review of the Tinder App. It's hilarious, but also soooo true!

Where Can You Find Free iPhone Porn?,"The internet is full of free pornography, and many sites are also catching up with the trend by becoming mobile-friendly.

This is great news for porn connoisseurs around the globe - many of whom are sick of finding access to their favorite x-rated sites restricted when they attempt to browse them using a mobile device.

The iPhone users guide to porn
As a smartphone user myself, I totally understand the challenges that finding porn on an iPhone entails.

Even some of the biggest names in the porn industry have yet to update to a responsive web design (a website that's designed to be viewed regardless of your device's size - no pun intended).

This conundrum leaves iPhone users struggling to use adult sites which are often skewed or impossible to navigate on a smaller screen.

Let me tell you, when you've got your hands busy, using a non-mobile site on a small touchscreen is no easy task!

Granted, some sites do have mobile versions, but these rarely offer as much content as does the full-screen experience.

What are the best sites for free iPhone porn? Based on some unsatisfactory experiences myself, I decided to do some research into which mobile porn sites generate the most traffic.

At first, I was discouraged to find that search engine results for 'best mobile porn site in the world' returned a list of poor-quality, pop-up-heavy adult websites.

I then decided that the only way to find the best mobile porn site would be to examine published figures regarding mobile video traffic.

According to an article ironically posted on blackberryreview.com, the best porn sites for iPhone users are the following (all of these rank in the top 10 mobile video sites overall):

xvideos.com
youporn.com
pornhub.com
tnaflix.com"
,"What's the problem to open PornHub from iOS? You can easily get access to any kind of porn from iPhone, I didn't notice any special restrictions here. I love to hang at webcams like https://www.sexedchat.com/ and Chaturbate, iOS was never a problem.
Good luck :)"
,"Here is a great source created precisely for mobile gadgets fire cam mobile , I can highly recommend it. There are a lot of different webcam categories, you can choose any and enjoy live shows if you're 18+.
Best of luck!"
,"Guys, I don't know, if it`s a problem or not, but I began to realize that I like scat porn. I watch it secretly from my girlfriend, I'm afraid to tell her the truth. Is it really awful or not? Does anybody do the same? Do your partner know about your watching this shitting stuff? It is so strange but I really like it..."
,"To my mind, Scat Full Movies are what a scat p?rn lover should really like to watch, for I'd say a scat p?rn theme offers so many opportunities considering the making of such a movie, its plot, sh*t can be shot and shown so as to make viewers get excited, please do as many of them as possible guys!"

Your comments of late, seem to show your lack of ability to treat people fairly. Maybe if you adjust that thinking, you will be better anle to suceed at life."

"What to do? My boyfriend was sent a pic of some girl's boobs a few months ago but it's still on my mind. I'm not sure if he's friends with this girl or not, but I've been cheated on in the past and I do not want it to happen again.","""... A few months ago ...""
Since you don't mention anything happening since then ... You either trust him or you don't.  If you don't trust him, you shouldn't be his girlfriend."
,"I've been cheated on too, so I know how you feel. But, honestly, if it wasn't the guy you are with now that cheated, you have no reason to not trust him. Now if he did it more than that once, yeah you could be worried. But I assume he deleted the picture, right? If he kept it, that would be a reason to get mad. (As I can tell you don't like the fact he got the picture at all.) It wouldn't hurt to just explain this to him and just ask if he talks to the girl or not. If he talks to her, you could ask him not to. It's your relationship, you're allowed to speak up if you don't like something."
,"Well, really....he can't control what other people send him, if it's a picture of a dog or someones breasts. Did you ever think it might be a female who wants to break you up so she can have him? Just a thought......it's just a picture."
,"I would call that crossroads. Don't trust him, maybe I'm wrong about him, but it's better than regretting it. If you can't communicate with him and figure it out between you two then there is no point. And that would make no sense to trust someone in that situation.
He is more then likely, messing with your head. Understand?"
"I have proof that mom is cheating on dad. It's been happening for years with not just one but multiple men (and women) and I don't think she has any intention of stopping, and in fact is having a guy over next week when the family is away. What should I do?",I suggest you talk to your mom. And tell her if that is really healthy for the family and herself because of what she is doing
,F your mom. Tell your dad about it. You need to be on his good side when they get divorced because he's going to get all the money since your mom is a lying cheating wh*re.
"Would you tell either parent you knew for a fact the other one was cheating? You have undeniable proof and a somewhat confession, mixed with lies.",I'm good at staying out of situations like that.
,"No thank you. It would not be my place to interfere in my parents' marriage. If there was infidelity going on, sooner or later things will blow up in the cheater's face without my help."
,"Why do you distinguish between a ""parent"" and a ""spouse?""---is that significant in this situation?"
What are the classic signs that a wife is cheating?,"Locking their phone, taking calls in another room away from you, whispering on the phone, buying new clothes, mainly sexier types of undergarments, wearing makeup more often, having excuses to leave the house (like ""oh, I forgot to get milk, I have to run out and get some), not as affectionate with you as she once was. There's a lot of signs to look for, but basically if you suspect it, it's probably true. Everyone should always trust their gut feeling."
What Are All The Major Signs That Tell You Your Significant Other Is Cheating On You?,"Well, if the other one is cheating on you then the first sign would be he won't be able to look you in the eye, and he'll find himself less confident while speaking to you about anything. He will start giving you excuses for silly things, say you ask him to go out for something may be a movie or a dinner, and if he is really cheating on you then he surely will be concerned about the other person and will not like to mingle around with you most of the times. And you are the best person to judge on this. Its your life and you are the decision maker here. So make a move after knowing everything."
,"Signs of cheating include: Hiding things from you, lying, going out more(w/o you), staying out late, any changes in routine, changes in your sex life, wanting to look good & smell good when they didn't before, anything that is out of the norm. Or is out of character for them, being distant, less affectionate and giving you less attention..etc. Hope this helps."
What are the signs that your boyfriend is cheating?,"I've been lucky enough in life to never have  been on either side of infidelity so far ..unless I'm completly oblivious ,  which I don't think I am. Anyway , one sure sign of someone being unfaithful to me would be that he would be missing a limb or be seriously seriously  wounded in some way.  There's your sign."
,Always lying and getting caught.
,He makes up excuses and works later ours but is really with some other girl.
,Everyone gave you some wonderful answers how ever I want to add in that a lot of times you DO get a gut feeling. Just you gotta make sure that it is not FEAR that you think it is a gut feeling......

How Can You Get Rid Of Dark Circles Under Your Eyes?,"Raspberries have been proven to at least lighten the dark circles and reduce swelling under the eyes. Eat a few every day. Also, there are many cheap eye creams at drugstores that you can buy that also moisturize and reduce swelling and inflammation."

try getting your husband to look after the baby and send the dog to the dog hotel or whatever!

this should help.

Rate me please"

,"Some people get dark circles under their eyes and they tend not to lighten.  You can cut slices of potato and rub them on the dark circles, or any dark blemishes. The starch in the potato will help lighten them.   Of course rest helps too, I am not ignoring those facts.
Give it a try."
,Yep. Just try and get more sleep and take some time for yourself!
,"Many of us have, at some point in our life, been haunted by undereye dark circles. Unhealthy lifestyle choices, bad genes, excess exposure to UV rays, and allergies are some reasons that can result in the skin problem. Under Eye dark circles can impact a person’s overall appearance, often lowering their self-esteem and confidence. To help address the problem, experts offering hyperpigmentation treatment packages in Delhi and other parts of the country, over the years, have come up with specially formulated creams to remove dark circles.
In addition to using under eye dark circle removal creams, people suffering from under eye dark circles can also try easy home remedies that are known to treat the problem."
,try and get some sleep.
,Try to take 20 mins out of your life and pamper yourself. Clense and tone then lie down and get some cucumber slices and put them on your eyes and chill for as long as you can and this should help
National flashlite day. National homeless persons day . and national french frech fried shrimp day.. I know i have been homeless before. So any of of these floats ypur boat??????????????????????????????????????,"  Good morning Otis!

,"What makes me scratch my head the most is how often people make fun of California for having a lot of homeless people. The reality is that had they settled anywhere else, they wouldn’t be homeless people, they would be dead.
I’ve spent quite some time with them. When I was 10 or so my grandparents ran an antique shop downtown and I would ride my scooter around befriending all the weird and wacky homeless people. They called me scooter kid. For the most part, they’re not starving or lacking food. Not in the least bit. You can walk into the food bank my family volunteers at and walk out with 3 grocery bags full of nutritios food for a whole month. What most of these people suffer from are addiction and mental health problems. These problems are rather difficult to solve since you can place clinics on every corner, but the only way they work is if the individuals get themselves into the clinic by their own free will. There lies the problem.
Sad fact, 40% of homeless people in my area are veterans."

What Is Pigmentation? How To Get Rid Of Pigmentation?,"Pigmentation is discoloring of the skin that usually occurs when the skin has been exposed to the sun and has been damaged. Freckles, age spots and other discoloration are the most common forms of skin pigmentation. Some people are born with freckles while others develop them as they age and have been exposed to the sun.
Age spots, also known as liver spots, and other pigmentation issues can be reduced although you should always consult your doctor before trying to fade them. You can purchase over-the-counter exfoliating products containing alpha hydroxyl that can be used on the hands, face, arms, legs, chest and shoulders to reduce pigmentation marks. These exfoliators should be used at night time and they remove dead skin cells to reveal the unpigmented skin after regular use.
There are also daily exfoliators that you can use during the day in conjunction with sun block to help protect your skin. Both the night and day exfoliation process takes a few weeks to work. You may notice fast results if the pigmentation you are trying to fade is light.
Some people prefer to use natural bleachers on their skin such as vitamin C and lemon juice. You would apply both to the area you wish to fade.  Vitamin C also helps protect your skin and it may help reduce ageing signs by regenerating and tightening the skin.
Always test products on an area of skin that is less visible to ensure that you do not get a rash or other irritation from it. When going out in the sun, wear a hat, sunglasses and sun block to protect your skin from developing other pigmentation problems. If you have any problems with any over-the-counter products, discontinue use and see your doctor right away. He or she may have a product that is better for your particular needs."
,"I hate looking into the mirror because of my dark patches on my cheeks. I've had this ugly problem since 8 years. I've tried everything possible but nothing seems to work. Please help!!!!
What is the most effective way without having any side effects?"
,"There are two definitions of pigmentation.
1-Natural Color (of plants and animals)
2-Discoloration (abnormal coloring in plants or animals because of a disease).
You should apply a few skin lightening products and also, keep yourself protected from the sun. The sun will further darken discolored areas. Hydroquinone Night Cream is very effective in pigmentation."
,"Pigmentation is basically just the colouring of the skin. If you are wanting to remove pigmentation and have a lighter complexion, especially for specific areas of darker pigmentation, there are products (mainly creams) that you can use to reduce this, e.g. - this one here. The other option is laser treatment, but that is normally used for more specific blemishes and smaller areas of abnormal pigmention (that is, abnormal to the majority of your skin colour).

Try having a look around online for more products and maybe even go into a couple of stores to test whats best.

In my opinion however, with skin being the largest organ of your body, it's not something that should be mucked around with. If your skin is healthy, regardless of the colour, I reckon you should count your blessings and give yourself a hug."
,"Pigmentation is caused by pigment called melanin , which is produced by the cells called melanocytes , it helps us to with stand heat and protects our body from harmful radiations and prevent diseases like skin cancer

there are medicines designed to reduce the count of melanocytes and glutathione tablets can reduce skin tone"
