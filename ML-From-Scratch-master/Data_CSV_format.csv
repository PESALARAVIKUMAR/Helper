But yes, the odds are that they will have sunk under the desert sands in a few hundred years, or at least their population centers. First you have global warming, and the shifts in the sands that will cause. Then you have desert drift, and the shifts in the coastline that will cause. It is not a good prescription for stability.

1,"Girls and shopping go together like beer and pretzels. No-one fully understand why it works, but it just does. Read on to get some more insight into this perplexing phenomenon.

Women and shopping: Why girls love to shop.

The desire to own nice things isn't unique to women. Throughout history, men have been just as obsessed by their possessions, if not more so.

In my opinion, it's the idea of options and choice that women enjoy. They enjoy picking out and matching outfits, they are enticed by the brands and the images these brands portray.

In a sense, shopping is a lot like hunting. Women spend hours stalking around shops observing and comparing, building up to that moment when they finally decide to go for the kill (and max your credit card out) in one fell swoop.

Why women are hooked on shopping?


My view on the shopping 'pandemic' is that women are actually the victims in this cycle. In these days of consumerism, we are constantly bombarded with opportunities to shop. From shopping channels like QVC to the 'retail experience' that department stores offer, shopping has become more than the simple act of acquiring goods in exchange for money.

From Denver to Dubai, the world is full of extravagant shopping malls and major retailers that have become household names."
1,"In this modern world of fashion, style has become a statement. Today for every girl to look presentable has become an important factor. And so shopping for cosmetics, clothes, bags, sandals, shoes, etc has become a daily routine.

Girls generally prefer variety in their clothing. They need to have new collection practically every week. And so shopping on a weekend has become a part of daily life.

Being well-dressed and looking good is very important. Every girl wants to look better than the other. Some of the factors that are looked for are combination of colors, the types of sandal or shoes for clothing accessories etc.

However, for those who are not fashion freaks, there are other things for example scented candles, hosiery stuff, etc to shop for."
0,"I think everyone loves shopping, not only girls."
1,It has always been that way. Girls get very excited to shop. Just like boys like sports.
0,"Males love shopping too, always have to look sharp. Except they tend to be more private about it and go shopping alone discretely. Or just order online."
0,"What kind of sexist moron wrote that?

Are you saying that ""girls"" who don't go shopping every day for cosmetics are not presentable? Maybe because they are too busy using their brains instead, eh?!"
1,"The Girls or women like shopping very much rather than other things because they want to show off their desires and status. You may belive or not,  to get the matching things whether they are clothing or footwear or anything, they may visit around all shopping stores to check. Even they don't bother about the money or time in their searching. If the matched one or desired one has been found, that must be purchased irrespective of its price. Even they moslty like to shop clothing, footwear, jewelry and also spend more time for choosing them."
0,"Shopping can sometimes be therapeutic for girls. In the same way as
video games or fishing can be for some men. Shopping can take your mind
off of boy problems or school or work issues. You get to take your mind
off of problems and focus on buying a little present or presents for
yourself. Many girls like to look pretty and dress to impress and you
can't do that unless you go shopping. At the end of the day you get atl
east one good item that will brighten your day(s). Shopping can also be a
way to bond with your friends. Research shows that 'cave women' would
gather food, like shopping for them. During this time, women would talk
and bond. Perhaps this has be carried on through the generations and is
now in the form of shopping. Sometime, women talk about their problems
to others while looking at earrings, again, being therapeutic. And who
doesn't like a new dress, it's another type of clothing you can look
good in!         "

0,"Such women, this is inherent in our blood.  I think it's like a drug, if you try, you can not stop.  By the way, I have many friends who like to shop.  We are all egoists by nature, we love to encourage ourselves.  For example, I like buying accessories for my smartphone, since I spend a lot of time with it.  And I always want to fill it in and update it.  Recently I found a cool site with a novelty that transformed and made it easier for me to use my gadget.  This stabilizer is very convenient and necessary bestrobotsguide.com/best-smartphone-stabilizers  I am very pleased with him."
0,"It's not that girls only love shopping because in the real life if we observe we find lot of options where boys to order everytime online. I think shopping is the only way that women find to step out from their regular works and spend time for themselves otherwise normally thee won't spend in outings, no plans every week as men do so shopping is the one way that they engage themselves and enjoy new findings.
Moreover, in this new fashion world, everything changes in hours so there is no doubt that last visit and present change lot in stores. So, this frequent visit to shopping is also a way for women to find the new things and get the most liked."
0,"You see it in every shopping mall: Men sitting outside the clothing store waiting for the wife to come out. Why is it that women love to try on every pair of shoes before deciding whether to buy anything at all, and men want to get out of the mall seconds after they get in?
It's all in the genes, according to Daniel Kruger, an evolutionary psychologist at the University of Michigan. Kruger argues that it's natural for women to love to shop and men to hate it because of our evolutionary past.
Men were the hunters in our ancestral cultures, so when they find a satisfactory specimen, whether it's an elk or a pair of shoes, they want to shoot it and get out before it gets away.
Women, by contrast, were the primary gatherers in early hunter-gatherer cultures, so they feel a need to check every berry on the bush to make sure they're getting the best deal."

I'm a Naturopath and a best-selling Amazon author who has helped over 14,793 women and men reclaim their health, fitness, and happiness with the advice they needed to improve their physical well-being.
As a professional weight-loss expert, I was ashamed and frustrated by the weight I'd gained after a difficult and complicated pregnancy. No matter which of my time-tested techniques I tried, I just couldn't get rid of pounds and pounds of stubborn excess fat!
It was like I was a stranger in my own body, trapped in a shell I didn't even recognize anymore. The worst part was that I couldn't seem to do anything to get my life back to normal.
I was disappointed, ashamed, and more alone than I'd ever been. I felt absolutely helpless.
That all changed when I took a plane to Africa and discovered the delicious tea that made me burn body fat quickly and easily, without feeling hungry.
Now, you need to read this article until the very end, because I'm actually going to give you this revolutionary ancient tea recipe today.

0,"In a world where weight loss is highly discussed and so are the different issues that are accompanied by obesity and excessive weight gain, a very important topic of weight gain is skipped. Weight gain is a very serious issue, just like weight loss is. However, a person who needs help with it, hesitates and is shy in discussing the problem mainly because people think that weight gain is not so important. Obviously, who would want to gain weight? This is because people focus on how they should look on the outside. This has become a status symbol of beauty and people do not realize how and what an underweight person has to go through especially in the matter of health. There are numerous health issues that such a person has to face and many of those have been mentioned below.
In order to modify your body to its ideal condition, you have to follow a lot of processes. Weight gain is a very slow and difficult process just like weight loss is. Basically, an underweight person lacks all the essential things that his or her body needs. All the essential vitamins, nutrients and the goodness of foods that the person needs to lead a happy and healthy life, are missing from their bodies. Hence, they face numerous different diseases and in short, illnesses are the outcome. So the importance of knowing and maintaining the healthy weight range cannot be neglected. To check your health conditions regularly use health calculators.
The purpose of a person, must not be to become stick thin and look extremely thin, they must consider health in all of this because only a healthy body can make it through the end. And that can be done only if one has the right figure of weight. So before starting up the process, one must estimate and calculate what their healthy weight range is as it varies not just with age but also with height and gender and therefore, it is different from different people. So knowing your healthy weight and then working for the balance of your weight is a much more sensible and practical approach rather than doing things without any awareness.
ILLNESSES OR HEALTH ISSUES THAT AN UNDERWEIGHT PERSON HAS TO FACE:
There are a number of different health issues that an underweight person has to go through. This might come to you as a shocker. Basically, an underweight person has a lot of deficiencies due to a poor diet. So, all the different diseases that they have to face, basically concern the deficiencies or are due to them. Some of these are listed below.
1- Anemia.
Obviously, you do not get the proper diet that means you are an iron deficit. Anemia is very common nowadays among people and many kids have to go through this. Anemia also results in poor focusing of the child at school and other educational institutes.
2- Pregnancy complications and delivery difficulties.
Pregnancy is a very complex method and your body needs a lot of strength for it. You have to maintain a healthy body, not only for your own self but also for the sake of your little one.
3- Vitamin deficiencies.
You do not know how immensely important, vitamins are for your body. And you have to get a vitamin-rich diet to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
20 FOOD PLANS FOR WEIGHT GAIN:
 When selecting the food plans that you need for the process of weight gain, you must go for the ones that are mineral, vitamin, calorie, and carbohydrate-rich because for gaining fat and getting a healthy body, these are all a must and you do need them in excess.
1- Seafood.
If you are a seafood lover and you intend on gaining weight then you must go for your fishes such as salmon which is an oily fish. Salmon is rich in Omega-3 fatty acids which are very healthy and essential for the body. It will help you gain weight and calories. Also, fish contains a high content of proteins and carbs and yes, all the healthy fatty acids as mentioned above.
2- Fruits.
For the maintenance of a healthy weight, you must not skip fruits from your diet. Avocado, bananas, apples and etc. Are all known to be the home of carbohydrates, and proteins. These yummy treats even help you in many other ways apart from weight gain. Fruits help in making your hair healthier, your skin glower, and you look much happier and content with life. So all the extra benefits with weight gain, what else do you need?

3- Dry fruits.
Oh and let's not skip how dry fruits can help. Dry fruits are saturated with sugar and hence they are not helpful when it comes to the purpose of weight loss. But definitely for weight gain. Dry fruits make a yummy treat for the purpose and provide you with a lot of minerals and good fatty acids.

4- Wholegrain and oats.
If you need a synonym of carbohydrates, then you have oats and wholegrain. These are a home to carbohydrate. They can help you gain weight in a very healthy manner. However, one must avoid processed food and go for the natural ones because artificial things do not have any goodness in them.
5- Cheese.
Coming to dairy products, you can use this yummy treat in so many different ways. Either slice your cheese and use it in your sandwich or either shred it and add taste to your boring meals. Or if you don’t like the idea, then melt it and eat it with your pasta or go for baked pasta. Cheese is known to be fattening and will help you gain weight in no time.
6- Milk.
Okay, did your grandmother ever tell you about how important a glass of milk before bed was? Well, she was kind of right. Milk provides you with calcium, proteins and etc. It helps in making your bones stronger. You can go for milkshakes for extra goodness. Chocolate milkshakes banana milkshakes and etc. All are very helpful.
Milk also has lactic acid in it.
7- Dark chocolate.
Before starting with dark chocolate, know that it has round about 600 calories per bar. The numerous health benefits that dark chocolate brings cannot be neglected. Dark chocolate is your heart’s best friend. It is very good for the lowering of blood pressure. You can eat one bar of this yummy treat and keep yourself healthy.
8- Smoothies.
if you are a smoothie lover, then you are at the right place. Chocolate smoothie, vanilla smoothie, or a fruit smoothie, go for whichever you like and see the progress in your weight gain journey. Smoothies are immensely healthy for you.
9- Whole yogurt.Well, here comes another dairy product.
Yogurt is a very yummy treat. You can go for flavored yogurts or even make your own fruit-flavored yogurt to spice things up and to add taste to them.
10- Potato.
Potato is known as a storage house of starch. There are so many different ways in which potatoes can be eaten. You can go for boiled potatoes, or mashed ones with your melted cheese to add extra goodness and a lot of flavor to it.
11- Cereal bars.
Well if you are officially going, and have a very busy and consumed up routine, then cereal bars are what you must go to. Cereal bars are extremely healthy. You can choose the whole nut and grained one to get all the benefits of nuts and grains. These make excellent snacks and are very tasteful. You can simply grab one and save your time especially if you do not have the time to sit and schedule your diets and make something for yourself. You can stay healthy with these cereal bars.
12- Whole Grain.
Well, whole grains have everything that you need for weight gain in a lot of moderation. You can even go for whole grain bread and to add some extra benefits and goodness to your diet, you can eat your whole grain bread with eggs and other things which will provide you with different nutrients. You can find the perfect match for the whole grain bread and that is a rich source of protein and that would make a very healthy diet for you.
13- Supplements.
Protein supplements, like whey proteins, are the best friends of bodybuilders and muscle gainers. Supplements can help you get what you need. However, all that you get in the form of supplements can be acquired naturally. You get the protein shakes in the form of powders and you can further make a shake with the help of this powder. However, the supplements are usually expensive especially if you are looking for the good quality ones and it is better to get the benefits naturally in the form of food if you are not willing to spend money on them.
14- Rice.
Rice is also very helpful. Being rich in carbohydrates, rice is known to provide you with about more than 180 calories on 43 grams. You can eat rich with your leafy green vegetables or even with your potatoes to spice things up and get a very healthy, yummy treat for yourself which will help you gain weight in like no time. You can make a known quantity of rice for your self and even make use of them and that will help you save a lot of time especially if you have a busy schedule and a consumed routine.
15- Meat.
Referring to meat and specifically ‘’red’’ meat is very healthy. Red meat helps you take in a lot of calories into your body. Also, it has countless carbs and Lucien, which helps the body add another layer of muscle, can be consumed by the body through the help of none other than red meat. Meat makes you feel filled and you cannot just for the purpose of weight gain without including meat and specifically red meat into your diet.
16- Leafy green vegetables.
The leafy green vegetables, like spinach and etc. Are a rich source of fiber to the body. Spinach is known to provide your body with energy and usually, the underweight bodies lack the energy. Therefore, vegetables like spinach, are very helpful to them.
Leafy green vegetables have countless other benefits which cannot be ignored. In short, not mentioning them into the diet for an underweight person is more like being unjust to them. This is how immensely important they are.
17- Peanut butter.
Oh, do you know that your favorite peanut butter spread has more than 85 calories? You can use your peanut butter on your whole nut bread and make it look delicious as well as super healthy for yourself. Peanut butter has a high protein content in it. Or you can even make your own peanut butter biscuits or cookies.
18- Ice cream.
Now let’s first get to the ingredients present in the ice cream. Ice cream is basically made out of milk. In addition to milk, is saturated with a high quantity of sugar. Coming towards the flavors, it can be fruit flavored, chocolate flavored and countless other ones which increase its goodness and multiply it by many times. Ice cream can just make the process a lot more fun and delicious and you will develop an interest in eating.
19- Mayonnaise.
Mayonnaise is highly packed with calories. They help you gain weight. You can use mayonnaise topping in a low amount of things such as your burger, your French fries, or even when you decide on making club sandwiches. Mayonnaise can be an extra treat for you and can help you gain weight and make you feel healthy.
20- Pasta.
Pasta has an estimated amount of more than 300 calories. But imagine you mixing your pasta with many other ingredients such as vegetables, chicken and etc. All of these ingredients will not just add taste to your pasta but take it from the health point of view, they will also provide you with all that your body desires and needs for the process of weight gain."

I have now completed numerous races, including the Zombie Run and Run or Dye. After your workout has hgh supplement as its fully natural and does not cause any harm to the body. I always recommend it to every individual.
2. Don’t get discouraged: There was a point where I hit a wall and could not get past 200 pounds. Proteins play a major role in our body. I would fluctuate between 200 and 210 pounds for nearly three months. I eventually changed the way I was eating and tried different approaches to working out, such as doing Insanity at home, and eventually, I broke through 200 pounds. Remain focused, keep pushing through, and don’t give up.”
3. Track your efforts: I chose to work with a personal trainer from the start, and he encouraged me to keep a daily journal of my weight, blood pressure, blood sugar levels, water intake, mood, amount of sleep, duration and type of exercise, and everything I put in my mouth. We also did monthly measurements so I could see my progress, all of which helped to keep me accountable."

1,"Try keto diet
The ketogenic diet puts your body into a state of ketosis, which ultimately allows you to use fat for energy.
Fat burning is just one of the many benefits of ketosis that improves overall health and makes it an effective tool for weight loss.
Keto has a cult following for a good reason: It makes you feel great. Keto-ers feel more satiated throughout the day and have increased energy levels, both physical and mental, leading to:
Fewer cravings
Lower caloric intake
More self-control
More physical activity.
These benefits all contribute to weight loss; however, keto is not synonymous with weight loss.
Far from being a magic tool, the ketogenic diet takes accurate and diligent tracking and adjustment to work. You need a balance of the right macros, realistic goal setting and tracking to take you closer to achieving your weight loss goals.
In this guide, we’ll cover the following:
What is Ketosis
What are KetonesBenefits of Ketosis
The Ketogenic Diet
What is the Ketogenic DietKetogenic Foods: What to Eat and What to Avoid
Designing a Keto Plan for Weight Loss
Using a Keto Macro CalculatorExerciseIntermittent FastingDealing with Plateaus
Testing and Tracking Results
How to Test Ketone LevelsThe Glucose-Ketone IndexBody Fat Tracking/PhotosTape MeasurementsUsing the Scale
Making Adjustments to Your Keto Diet
How to Adjust to Induce KetosisReview Your Goals and Results
By the end of this guide, you’ll have everything you need to get started on the ketogenic diet to lose weight the right way — for the long term.
Ketosis is a metabolic state in which your body uses fat rather than glucose from carbohydrates as its primary source of energy.
To achieve ketosis, you stop supplying your body with carbs and sugar. This depletes your stored glucose — also known as glycogen — and your blood sugar and insulin levels decrease. Your body starts to look for an alternate source of fuel (fat), releases it and burns it for energy.
Hence, weight loss on keto.
Because of the decrease of glucose and increase in the metabolism of fat, ketosis has a ton of benefits — its unique ability to induce weight loss is just one of them. Many people use ketosis as a treatment for epilepsy, diabetes and even cancer.
When your body burns fat, it produces ketones. Without ketones, you’re not in ketosis.  Therefore, the ketogenic diet’s sole purpose is to aid and promote ketone production.
WHAT ARE KETONES?
Ketones are the metabolic fuel produced when your body shifts into fat-burning mode.
Glucose and ketones are the only energy sources used by the brain. Think of ketones as the auxiliary power source of your body.
Before the advent of agriculture, when our ancestors were hunter-gatherers, they fasted regularly. When food was scarce, they didn’t have a choice but to wait for an opportune time to hunt for food and cook it.
They had a very low intake of carbs and protein and thus were unintentionally running on ketones. Converting stored fat into energy is hardwired for our survival and a natural part of human existence.
Your body burns fat to use and produce ketones whenever glucose sources are low or depleted, such as:
during fasting
after prolonged exercise
when you eat a ketogenic diet.
Lipase (an enzyme responsible for fat breakdown) releases stored triglycerides (fats). These fatty acids go to your liver and your liver turns them into ketones. 
There are three types of ketone bodies:
Acetoacetate – During the breakdown of long- and medium-chain fatty acids for energy, acetoacetate is produced first.
Acetone – Spontaneously, acetone is also produced as a by-product of acetoacetate. Both of these ketone bodies, when not used, spill into your urine and breath, making urine and breath testing a promising measurement of whether or not you’re going into ketosis. More on this below in How to Test Ketone Levels.
Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) – Not technically a ketone but a molecule. Its essential role in the ketogenic diet makes it count as the important ketone body. BHB is synthesized by your liver from acetoacetate. BHB is important because it can freely float throughout your body in your blood, crossing many tissues where other molecules can’t. It enters the mitochondria and gets turned into ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the energy currency of your cells. BHB = ATP = energy!
Now that you know what ketones are and how ketosis works, you probably want to know why you should consider eating a ketogenic diet — the diet that promotes ketosis.
The Benefits of Ketosis
The benefits of ketones come from your body burning fat for fuel and the lowered glucose and insulin in your blood.
The benefits of ketosis include:
Body fat burning
Mental clarity and increased cognition
Improved physical energy
No feeling of deprivation because you experience less hunger[*]
Steady blood sugar levels from little to no intake of refined carbs
Skin improvements in those with acne[*]
Improved triglyceride and cholesterol levels[*]
Hormone regulation — women who go on keto report less severe symptoms of PMS[*].

Within each of these sections, not all workers are necessarily doing the same type of work, for the same company, who has outsourced their work to the BPO. One person may be cutting checks for company A and the next person my cutting checks for company B. It all depends upon the size of the BPO and how many companies have outsourced their work to them."
1,"The fundamental difference between a call center and a BPO is that a call center is be a BPO but a BPO may not be a call center. BPO is an abbreviation for Business Process Outsourcing. The process that is outsourced can be broadly classified into voice based and data based.

A call center is a voice based process. An example of a call center could be an insurance firm that chooses to sell insurance by cold calling potential clients. If it is based in the United States then the firm could choose to move the entire process to an Asian country. Agents will be hired in the Asian country and they will be trained. The act of selling insurance has been moved from the United States to a call center in Asia.

Since the business process outsourcing boom was primarily facilitated by the advent of call centers they have become synonymous with each other."
1,"Call centers specifically handles calls which are telephone based traffic and involved in activities such as telemarketing, managing customer queries, complaints etc.  On the other hand BPO is engaged in activities like Payroll Billing, Back Office Processing, call center activities and etc."
0,"In simple term I would like to explain the difference between Call Center and
BPO's.
Call Center is generally a sub-unit of BPO, Call Center is a place where
people take and make a call to/from a customer, to provide information. If we
take a call it's an Inbound call center, and If we make a call it's an outbound
call center.
BPO stands for Business process outsourcing. This is a much bigger conception than a call center. Generally companies outsource any department to an organization. They
provide advance training to an employee and different departments like
accounting, development and call centers, Technical Supports etc.
BPO is such a broad term  to maintain foreign policies and customer
supports."

1,"Today, laparoscopic surgery is a broadly acknowledged surgical strategy that utilizations little entry points and long pencil-like instruments to perform activities with a camera. As the cuts are significantly littler than their open partners, recuperation is speedier and post-agent torment is commonly less. Methods, for example, hernia repairs, gastric sidestep, gut resection, and organ expulsion are presently routinely done laparoscopically.
Laparoscopic surgery Abu dhabi has effectively supplanted open surgery as the favored treatment alternative for issues, for example, bariatric surgery and gallbladder expulsion. Truth be told this surgery would now be able to be executed as an outpatient activity. The treatment of gastroesophageal reflux ailment is currently completed utilizing negligibly obtrusive procedures. Laparoscopic fundoplication offers the benefit of speedier recuperation and snappier come back to oral ingestion of nourishment. Laparoscopic surgery for weight reduction has gotten on bigly. Laparoscopy has progressed adequately to the degree that it can be rehashed for a patient who has experienced a past laparoscopic activity. In any case, mind should be taken than organs don't get harmed and to this end the passage site may must be unique and another section procedure may must be utilized. The hazard to profit proportion of laparoscopic surgery is enhancing consistently for benefits.
Chronicled Perspective For Minimally Invasive Surgery
There is general accord among medicinal students of history that the primary believably recorded occurrences of endoscopy can be credited to the Arabian doctor Albukasim (936-1013 A.D). Seven more hundreds of years were to go before any further advancements in endoscopy. In 1805, doctor Phillip Bozzini utilized a lit up light chamber, a tube, and mirrors for appearance keeping in mind the end goal to investigate the human urethra. He could see the urinary bladder and to picture stones and neoplasms.

Georg Kelling of Dresden, in exhibit day Germany, first utilized laparoscopes to see the peritoneal cavities of live canines. Stockholm - conceived doctor Hans Christian Jakobaeus was the main individual to make utilization of a laparoscope on different human patients. He saw diverse pathologies and he depicted conditions, for example, cirrhosis of the liver, metastatic growth, and tuberculosis peritonitis.

The development of laparoscopy was subject to advancements in wellsprings of light that did not cause consumes and focal points that amplified and expanded the field of view. For instance, in 1929, the presentation of another focal point framework that allowed sideways (135°) seeing promoted laparoscopy in Europe. The appearance of the double trocar strategy at around a similar time gave a further fillip to analytic laparoscopy. The technique empowered specialists to both imagine the stomach cavity and at the same time to pass instruments into the pits.
Optics And Laparoscopy
Advances in photography, optics, lighting, and access to the stomach depression have characterized the improvement of present day laparoscopy as we probably am aware it today. The method of ""chilly light"" fiberglass brightening presented by a group of French researchers in 1952 enhanced wellbeing by dispensing with the danger of intraperitoneal consumes and electrical flaws that occurred when utilizing intra-stomach wellsprings of light. The ""icy light"" originated from an extraordinary proximal light source outside of the stomach depression along a quartz bar to the distal end of an endoscope and it was sufficiently serious to allow photos to be taken. German architect and gynecologist Kurt Semm is attributed with having contributed the greatest to improvements in interventional insignificantly obtrusive surgical strategy. A programmed insufflation gadget planned by Dr. Semm in 1977 empowered specialists to screen the two gas stream and intra-stomach weight.

Dr. Semm likewise created methods for hitch tying and created instruments that could execute the required moves. He promoted strategies, for example, laparoscopic lysis of omental attachments, entrail suturing, and tumor biopsy and arranging. In 1981, Dr. Semm played out the main laparoscopic appendectomy.
How Have Visual Tubes Evolved?
Laparoscopic visual instruments have developed from endoscopy of which there is archived prove that it was utilized as far back as 1806 to inspect the channels and pits of the human body. The primary endeavor at laparoscopic examination of the peritoneal cavity was completed in 1901 and the strategy was named ""Celioscopy.""

Laparoscopic methods kept on creating and by 1930s, specialists were performing analytic biopsies of stomach organs under direct representation. The seventies saw laparoscopic methods being normally utilized by gynecologists. In any case, its spread when all is said in done surgical practice was constrained in light of the fact that it didn't encourage complex surgical strategies due to the restricted field of view and the way that the specialist's hands were possessed in holding the laparoscope.

Accordingly, the year 1986 imprints a watershed occasion in the advancement of laparoscopic surgery since it was in this year that the video PC chip was produced. This improvement empowered specialists to extend amplified pictures onto TV screens and it made ready for more current and more intricate utilizations of laparoscopy. We can consider the year 1987 to be the year which genuinely proclaimed the entry of laparoscopic surgery. This is on the grounds that it was in this year that the primary laparoscopic cholecystectomy or gallbladder expulsion was first performed.
Surgical Dogma And Laparoscopy
However by and large specialists were reluctant to acknowledge laparoscopy as a really helpful type of surgery that required further examination and support. The purposes behind this are not clear but rather not having an unmistakable field of vision amid laparoscopy and surgical creed that had existed for quite a long time are a portion of the reasons that backed off the acknowledgment of this surgical system."
1,"Laparoscopic or “minimally invasive” surgical procedure is a specialized technique for performing surgery. In the past, this method changed into usually used for gynecologic surgery and for gall bladder surgery. Over the final 10 years the usage of this approach has elevated into intestinal surgery. In conventional “open” surgical treatment the health care professional uses a unmarried incision to go into into the stomach. Laparoscopic surgery makes use of numerous 0.5-1cm incisions. Each incision is referred to as a “port.”  At every port a tubular instrument known as a trochar is inserted.  Specialized devices and a unique digital camera known as a laparoscope are surpassed via the trochars for the duration of the method. At the start of the process, the stomach is inflated with carbon dioxide fuel to offer a operating and viewing space for the healthcare professional. The laparoscope transmits pictures from the belly hollow space to high-decision video monitors within the operating room. During the operation the health care professional watches unique photos of the abdomen at the screen. This device allows the medical professional to perform the same operations as conventional surgical treatment however with smaller incisions. Click here to you get more information about it."

1,"Hypnosis is defined as an altered state of awareness in which you appear to be asleep or in a trance. Clinical hypnosis may be used to treat certain physical or psychological problems. For instance, it is frequently used to help patients control pain. It is also used in a wide range of other conditions. Such as weight issues, speech disorders, and addiction problems. There is debate about how hypnosis works. Some people believe that when you are hypnotized, you relax and concentrate more, and are more willing to listen to suggestions

1,"Telephone survey advantages include:
• Call-backs can be used to reach difficult-to-reach but critical respondents
• A large number of interviews can be conducted in a short period of time
• Greater potential for receiving unbiased responses
• Greater control over sampling and quotas
• Can get ""specialized"" responses through screening questions
• Interviewers can ask probing, follow-up, or clarifying questions
• Permits ""skip and branching"" patterns
Telephone survey disadvantages include:
• Interviews can be easily terminated by respondents
• Respondents are not anonymous to the interviewers
• Costs can escalate quickly
• Cannot use visual aids
• Possible response bias if all interviewers do not conduct the survey in the same manner

1,"Survey through e-mail has the following advantages such as easy to circulate, lesser costs, easier to send greater number of participants, greater geographical coverage, easier to get the results and flexibility provided to the participants. However, people conducting the survey cannot control the behavior of participants or cannot monitor them because of different geographical locations of participants. The people conducting the survey cannot make sure the non-occurrence of undesirable conditions at the time when questionnaire was being filled by the participant. People might not return the questionnaire back or not fill it if they are not interested.

The advantages of telephone survey include: One to one communication between the participant and the person who is conducting the survey, easier geographical coverage, relatively lesser costs as compared to the direct interviewing and use of computerized software which dial the numbers randomly to select the even distribution or random sampling from the population. However the conductor has no control over the environmental condition of the respondent which might distort the responses of the respondent. The response rate can be low if people show unwillingness in responding to the survey."

1,"Communication is key in the world today and there are more forms available than ever before. The most common forms of media used for communication are:

• Print media
This form of media encompasses newspapers, magazines and leaflets. Print media is one the most popular and successful ways of communicating facts to people. Newspapers are used to provide people with news of the events that are happening throughout the world, and are vital to some people receiving information. Magazines provide facts, normally on specialist subjects, and these are useful to people with specific interests. Leaflets are useful for communicating business products and ideas to a mass marketplace. This information is printed and advertises the products to the potential customers.

• Broadcast media
Broadcast media generally covers radio and television, and this is an instant form of media, as the events that are talked about can be more up to date than they are in the printed media. The news on television can be updated on a minute-by-minute basis and this is now the case with rolling 24-hour news channels in most countries, relaying news as it breaks to the general public.

• Social media
Social media is media that is sometimes overlooked. This form of media involves word of mouth and its increase in recent years is down to social networking sites such as Facebook, although this can also fall under the rubik of electronic media.

• Electronic media
This type of media is more common since the advent of the Internet. The Internet is as instant as broadcast media, and most newspapers and television channels now have their own Internet sites that enable them to update information as it happens. Social networking sites such as Facebook and Tagged can also fall into this type of media."
1,"Tv, internet, cable, phone, etc."
1,"There are a number of ways in which people can communicate using the internet. The most popular and the oldest is email. Other ways to communicate on the internet are by entering internet chat rooms, through social networking sites like Facebook and Tagged, and by MSN Messenger, which enables instant communication between people. People can also talk to each other with the aid of webcams, enabling the users to not only hear each other, but also to see each other while they are talking. Email is the oldest form of internet communication, having been launched in the 1960s. Initially the electronic mails could only be sent between users who were connected to the same computer and these were in the form of text files that were delivered to a mailbox. In 1971, the first proper electronic mail message was sent to a different computer that was on the same network. Ray Tomlinson, an engineer who had been working on file transfer protocol and ARPANET, which was established prior to the internet, did this. Emails can now include text but can also incorporate video, images and sounds, and other files and documents can be attached to them. When mails are delivered they are encoded for privacy and upon reaching their destination are decoded so that the recipient can access and read them. Messages pass through a large mail server, which incorporates two different servers. One of these servers is known as the SMTP server and handles the mail that is being sent. The other server handles incoming messages and is known as the POP3 server. Wireless technology is another way of communicating over the internet. There are many hand-held devices available that can connect to the internet and these can be used to interact in the same way as when the internet is wired. Over 200 million people now use mobile internet access worldwide."
1,"The ways to communicate through the internet are chatting and video conference. Through chatting you can easily stay connected with family abroad or even get to know new people. Chat clients such as MIRC and YAHOO give you the opportunity to talk to new people and make new friends from all over the world. You can even watch and hear the people you know by using MSN Messenger, Yahoo Messengers and other instant messengers. You can call their computers and talk to them for free and save a lot that you would otherwise have to spend on an international call. You can also email people who may not be online while you are and get emails from them in turn, which you can read later. You can even send email and text messages to people on their cellphones by using certain websites. So, there are plenty of ways to communicate to people by using the internet."
1,"The Internet provides various ways of communication depending on the need and availability of hardware/software. These include e-mail, phone, instant messaging or I'm, short message service or SMS, video conferencing and Web conferencing. All these can be seamlessly integrated into one package if needed.

The two most popular ways at present are the e-mail and instant messaging (I'm) Interestingly, the e-mail predates the Internet. In the early days, the e-mail was an important tool in creating the Internet.

Instant messaging is different from e-mail. I'm can happen in real time and most I'm providers also add a few more services along with I'm. These can include file sharing and video and voice chat."

1,"In my opinion, the best way to make money online is to run your own website selling either goods or monetizing a service.
This is a very wide spectrum, there are so many things you could sell or services you could offer, so it really comes down to the following:
What resources you have available to you
What skills you possess
What is there demand for in the market?
Where is their the least competition in the market?
When eBay first launched in 1995, there was very little competition and it was able to claim a powerful position in the online retailer and auction market.
Since then, it has managed to negotiate the challenges of the past few decades, and it is currently one of the most profitable digital enterprises on the internet.
While it is unlikely that you'll create the next eBay overnight, you can take the same concept and look out for areas that people are demanding goods or a service, but where that demand isn't being fulfilled yet.
It sounds difficult, but companies are doing it all the time through the internet, so if you want to make lots and lots of money, then this is truly the best approach!"

0,"There isn't really a best way to make money online. Your ""best"" way to make money online will most likely defer from what someone else see as the ""best"" way to make money online. You need to find what works for you, and what you like, and then stick with it.
Some methods you can try out:
Start a blog in a niche you have some knowledge of. Write high quality content (or outsource the writing work) and then monetize the blog with affiliate links, cpa links and an ad-serving network such as Google AdSense.
Start a niche-based Amazon affiliate store. You can list several products from Amazon on your affiliate store and get paid commission every time your site refers a sale.
Start an online career as a freelancer. Consider your skills and knowledge, and then decide on a freelance career you want to engage in - graphic designer, article writer, data entry worker, virtual assistant, etc. You can join several freelancing sites such as Guru and UpWork.
If you're from the USA you can also apply to get paid for filling out surveys. Unfortunately only USA citizens get access to the surveys that actually pays good money. If you're not from the USA, you could still try it out but you won't be able to earn as much.
Give list building a go. Write a short report on a topic in a niche you have knowledge of, and then create a landing page offering the report you've written in exchange for an email address. You can then set up a list with an autoresponder like Aweber or GetResponse and start building a list - once you've collected a couple of email addresses you can promote affiliate products to your list of subscribers.
These ideas can help you get started online. If you're interested in building a list, here's a tutorial that walks you through the steps to set up a 100% free list building system: http://theprofitblogger.xyz/turn-your-wordpress-website-into-a-free-list-building-machine/"

Think about doing some freelance work, there's various websites like freelancer and upwork that might help you there. Considering selling some stuff on ebay, it's a great way of clearing space and making money at the same time.
Finally, consider online gaming. Whether it's a bit of online poker, blackjack or slots at Mr Green or PlayOJO. It's one of the more common ways of making a fast buck! Hopefully this helps and you start making money online!"

0,"Hi,
Earning money is not easy. Graduates are these days being rejected almost everywhere today. With this, you might be able to figure out where our market stands today. Though you can make money online but it sure won’t come easy. Here are a few ways how you can do that:
YouTube: This is one of the easiest ways to earn a lot of money, though it might come after investing a lot of time. You have to work on your content and keep it good. It might take a year or two to get settled but once settled in there is no stopping. There is no upper limits of how much you can earn through this channel. Monetize your videos and you are good to go. Top YouTube artists are earning upwards of 2 million dollars in a year with just adsense. Sponsorship and other offers will also be coming your way, keep an eye on it. Also, if you have uploaded a video on YouTube no matter how long ago, you would be eligible to earn money on it if it attracts views.
Blog Writing: If video making is something that you don’t see yourself doing in the coming years, then this is your second best option. Writing a blog can be done for free or by investing money and starting your blog on a separate domain. The more you you write, the more you earn. Quality material attracts more views. Write on trending topics and you’ll see your blog views shooting up. Checkfor setting up a free blog.
Freelancing: This is another way and is useful if you are trying to earn money but don’t have time to invest. With this, you won’t be earning big but cheques start raking in from the beginning itself. In this you will be selling your work, just like you do on a job. The benefit of freelancing is that you can work from home and you do not have to report to someone until the deadline is over. Work quality matters a lot with this kind of job. If quality is good, professionals would be typing your name in the list of people they want the work to be done from.  is pretty popular for this kind of work.
Few other ways are Work from home websites, selling stuff online, PTC websites, becoming a problem solver, completing surveys but these are not very reliable. If you are really investing your time make sure it is benefiting your future."

1,"Most of the time people get disheartened when they hear that the online world of earning quick money is a fraud. This is not always the case as there are legitimate and true ways to earn money while working from your home on computer.

The first and foremost legitimate way to earn money is to get a job as a freelance writer. There are many web site services which offer free lance writing services like you may be asked to write a project, summaries, abstracts etc. There are also companies that offer the jobs of transcribers. If your listening skills are good and you understand other languages easily then the job of transcriber will be good for you.

Also another way of earning money is to promote as an affiliate on sites like click bank.com or pay dot com.com. These are few companies which offer affiliate services where you can market the products of their affiliates by promoting their products on different sites like your blogs etc.

Another legitimate way of earning money is to read paid emails. There are different web site like cash mail.com which offer this service where you get paid for every email you read which they sent to you."

1,"The best app for editing photos depends on how much you are wanting to do with the photos. If you are just wanting to make very basic edits- eg. cropping, auto brightness and contrast, and set filters, you can do this quickly and easily on Instagram (although this is with a view to wanting to share the pictures afterwards).
If you are after something which offers more technical editing capabilities similar to that of, say, Adobe Photoshop on a ""regular"" computer, a program like Filterstorm may be more up your street. 
This app offers a whole range of editing capabilities, and even allows you to import photos in RAW format. It's not free, though. You'll have to pay £2.39 for it, so if you don't need all of these extra functions, you may be better off with a simpler app, like Adobe Photoshop Express which is free, and has excellent reviews on iTunes."

I allot myself a certain number of $ when I go to the casino.  When that amount is gone, I leave.  I consider it an entertainment fee.

There are three major groups covered by Search Engine Land’s Periodic Table Of SEO Success Factors:
On-the-page SEO
Off-the-page SEO
Violations
Within each group are subgroups, as each chapter of this SEO guide will explain. These subgroups contain one or more individual SEO factors with a specific weight or importance.
Violations, while a group unto themselves, are displayed under the group and subgroup to which they’re associated.
Those two-letter acronyms you see on the chart above? That’s our play on the periodic table of elements and the letter representations, or symbol, of each element. You may have had to remember that the symbol for gold was Au or that iron was Fe.
In the Periodic Table of SEO, we’ve tried to make it slightly more intuitive. The first letter of each “SEO element” comes from the subgroup that it’s in, and the second letter stands for the individual factor.
SEO factors work in combination
No single SEO factor will guarantee search engine rankings. Having a great HTML title won’t help if a page has low-quality content. Having many links won’t help if they are all low in quality. Having several positive factors can increase the odds of success, while the presence of negative factors can worsen those odds.
On-the-page success factors
On-the-page search ranking factors are those that are almost entirely within the publisher’s own control. What type of content do you publish? Are you providing important HTML clues that help search engines (and users) determine relevancy? How does your site architecture help or hinder search engines?
on page SEO tools for free, https://www.prepostseo.com.
Off-the-page success factors
Off-the-page ranking factors are those that publishers do not directly control. Search engines use these because they learned early on that relying on publisher-controlled signals alone didn’t always yield the best results. For instance, some publishers may try to make themselves seem more relevant than they are in reality.
With billions of web pages to sort through, looking only at “on-the-page” clues isn’t enough. More signals are needed to return the best pages for any particular search.
SEO violations & ranking penalties
Make no mistake — search engines want people to perform SEO because it can help improve their search results. Search engines provide help in the form of guidelines, blog posts, and videos to encourage specific SEO techniques.
However, there are some techniques that search engines deem “spam” or “black hat,” which could result in your pages receiving a ranking penalty, or worse, being banned from the search engines entirely.
Violations are general tactics meant to deceive or manipulate a search engine’s understanding of a site’s true relevancy and authority.
A weighting of search ranking factors
All the factors we show are weighted on a scale of 1 to 3, as shown in the top right corner of each factor, as well as reflected in the hue of that factor. A weighting of 3 is most important and is something you should pay special attention to because it has a bigger impact than other factors.
That doesn’t mean that factors weighted 2 or 1 aren’t important; they are. It’s just that they are of less importance, relatively speaking, in terms of the other factors on the chart. Violations are also weighted, but in negative numbers, with -3 being the worst and potentially most harmful to your SEO success.
The weighting is based on a combination of what search engines have said, surveys of the SEO community and our own expertise and experience in watching the space over time. We don’t expect them to be perfect. Not everyone will agree. Your mileage may vary. But we’re confident it is a useful general guide."

1,"A compilation is a grouping of important narrative essays; for example, a compilation of narrative essays may be chosen for publication because they all relate to a specific topic, such as politics, literature (such as reviews or essays about famous books), or science.

• Types of compilations

Often, a subject (for example, George Orwell`s stunning and prescient fiction work, 1984) will be studied in depth through a series of narrative essays, and these narrative essays will be bound in book format and released for students or other interested parties to read and learn from. In other situations, a famous pundit or author, such as the witty and bombastic right-wing writer, P.J. O`Rourke, will compile a list of their best narrative essays and release them in book form.

• Some writers shine in this format

Certain writers really shine in the narrative essay format, and these authors may enjoy supplementing their regular fiction or non-fiction works with groupings of narrative essays. British author Martin Amis, who alternates between stinging political and cultural narratives and post-modern fiction novels, is another example of a seasoned pro that often chooses to publish compilations of narrative essays in lieu of short stories or full-length novels.

• Write your own

Anyone who enjoys writing can make their own compilation of narrative essays, simply by collecting a group of higher-quality essays and arranging them in a logical way. Actually, making your own compilation can be excellent way to chart your progress as a writer; after all, over time, people who spend a lot of time creating essays will notice that their writing becomes more polished and professional. While reading through narrative essays that are compiled chronologically, writers may get a sense of how their writing is progressing and what potential still remains for significant improvement.

Bookstores and libraries may features special sections devoted to compilations of narrative essays."
1,"Generally, narrative essays involve two main components: A story and
some analysis of that story. A narrative essay may be ""about"" a
particular issue, theme, or concept, but it uses a personal story to
illustrate that idea.  "

1,"Compilation in general means a thing, especially a book, record, or broadcast programme, that is put together by assembling previously separate items.  The narrative essays are the detailed essays based on the personal experiences. All the personal stories of the writer are shared in these types of essays. The purpose of writing these essays is to introduce your personality to others and to understand it properly by yourself. All of your shared stories of life are read by people they get to know about different aspects of your life. It is not an easy task and everyone can’t do it appropriately. However, some authors really mastered this art and know the secret of turning their life’s story into the words perfectly.

If your essay is due tomorrow and you haven't written a word, do it now, or ask your teacher for an extension. It's just an essay, and it's an essay on a pretty easy subject, so sharpen your pencil, jot down a few thoughts, and then use their notes to type up something awesome.

1,"In literature, the resolution is the ending: Part of the story where the main conflict has been resolved and the story is coming to a close.

The Five Elements of Plot In literature, many theorists agree that you can divide a narrative plot into five stages:
Exposition - This is the beginning of the story, where the character and settings are established.
Rising Action - This usually where the problem or conflict is introduced. Something happens to disrupt the state of equilibrium that was established in the expository stage. 
Climax - Here, everything is brought to a head; the main conflict occurs.
Falling Action - The main conflict is over, and the story begins to slow down, coming to a close. Imagine this as the aftermath of a fight; cleaning wounds, fixing broken bones, making sure everybody is okay.
Resolution - A new order is established; this might be a return to the state shown in the expository phase, or it might be a new one. For good or for bad, this is the ending."
1,"The resolution is the part of a story's plot line in which the problem of the story is resolved or worked out. This occurs after the action and is typically where the story ends. Another term for the resolution is ""denouement,"" which comes from the French term ""denoue,"" meaning ""to untie.""
Usually, any questions that arose during the story are answered in the resolution.  All stories have a resolution, even if the author doesn't disclose every lastdetail to the reader. order book report"

you need to drive more organic traffic to your websites, it is imperative to increase

valuable SEO techniques. Here is the list of techniques that you can consider
to improve the keyword ranking.
ü  You should use long tail keywords because
they are less competitive and can make you receive more targeted traffic.
ü  If you get the high-quality backlinks, then
there will be the major hike in the keyword ranking.
ü  With the help of really detailed guides, you
will have more search visitors to your blog post."
1,"Page descriptions: Google may choose not to show your description on the SERPs, but it is still important to provide a custom description for each and every page of your website, especially the pages you want to rank higher.
Accurately describe the page content and include variations of your target keyword.
Look at the AdSense example above and see how nicely Google adds variations of its target keyword into the description (e.g., learn how to make money online, content monetization, make money).
H1 tags: Review your HTML code (open the page, go to “View Source” and search for H1). Check that your page has only one set of H1 tags. The H1 tag is not necessarily the same as your page title tag, but it should contain variations of your target keyword.
Page content: Back in 2011, Amit Singhal (head of Google’s ranking team) publishedan explanation of what Google considers to be a high-quality website. It’s one of the most important documents when it comes to SEO because it describes what Google is looking for when assessing a page’s value. Things like content quality, originality, formatting, in-depth analysis, presentation, and author trust play an important role.
Assuming that you got all those behind-the-scenes tips correct from the beginning, you need to ensure that your target keyword (and variations) is mentioned in the content of the page. I am not suggesting that you stuff the keywords in the text or over-optimize, but you need to check that the crawler in the page title and H1 tags are consistent with the page’s content.
Some tools can calculate the keyword density and make recommendations, but you don’t have to go that far; mentioning your keywords a couple of times in your content is enough.

An excellent way of incorporating long-tail keywords is through informative blog content aimed at a specific target audience.

You should also avoid using too many keywords. Optimize each web page or each post with at least two keywords. Do not use too many keywords as it may make your SEO unfruitful since the content will become unreadable. Rather, spread out the keywords and consider focusing one keyword per page.

3. Optimize Your Main Title Tag & Your Post Headline
A very important part of ensuring effective SEO is to optimize your main title tag. This ensures your site is more readily found when someone searches for the keywords. Thus, try using an interesting slogan, tagline or keyword just before your brand name.
The headline of every blog post or web page also needs to be SEO optimized. Ensure the headline is not only captivating enough for people to want to click but also descriptive enough to gain a better search engine rank.
4. Write An Engaging Meta Description
The term Meta description refers to the short description seen in search results below your headline. An engaging description will help in luring more traffic to your website.
5. Optimize Your Site Architecture & Your URL
Both users and also search engine spiders should not have to look very hard so as to find any content on your website. A general tip to use is to keep your most important web pages within at least three clicks from your homepage. An easy way of checking whether you have buried content too far is to evaluate your URL structure.
Having a clear and clean URL is also vital for building traffic through SEO. It not only makes your site quick and easy to crawl for the search engines, and also users can remember it easily and share.
6. Evaluate Usage Data & Website Speed
The usage data of your website has huge effect on your SEO practices. Evaluate this data and discover whether people are staying on your site for longer than one minute.
How quickly your website loads also affects your ranking on search engines. If your website loads too slowly due to excessive imagery of flash content along with other common performance problems, then it is high time to start evaluating ways of enhancing the loading speed
Off-Page SEO:
1. Build Audiences With Social Media (don’t forget Google +)
Social media has a great impact on your overall search results. Hence, a good place to start with off-page SEO is to create sharable content and post it in all your social media pages for effective link-building.
One simple trick to get more traffic is to use Google+ for business. It is heavily integrated with all aspects of Google and therefore sharing your content through this social media site will have a considerable effect on your overall search rankings.
2. Join Associations And Other Offline Groups
Offline associations and groups really have a positive effect on your SEO strategy, especially for building credibility for your website. You can also get indirect links from your peers, which all helps to position your website as one of the industry leaders in your field.
Links from schools and non-profits are quite valuable for SEO since they are considered as both high trust and high value. Consider donating either your money or time to a local charity in your area to receive these benefits.
3. Guest Blog To Get Backlinks And Traffic
Get in touch with other top websites in your field and creating informative and interesting content for them. This kind of partnership is essential to getting more traffic to your website."

Work Smart Not Hard - This Is Also One SEO Technique!!!
1. Build better content than your competitors. If they write content around 1000 words, you try to write around 1300 because the research says that the word count for ranking a website for mid-level of competition or higher the word count is around 2300.
2. Do better on-page seo like adding exact match keywords, LSI keywords and keyword density and more at relevant places [sprinkle them].
3. Add modifiers to the title.
4. Add LSI keyword in meta description.
5. Make use of heading tags properly.
6. Use images relevant and optimize them.
7. Proper internal linking.
8. Proper navigation of the site.
9. Put important posts or pages in sidebar google feels that these are important pages or posts of this site/blog.
10. First, find where your competitor is getting links and try the same for your website/blog.
11. If you want to rank locally, go for local seo like submitting local seo directories, google listings, local search engines and make sure you use your location in title and content so that google can know that this particular page is fit for specific location. [Follow NAP: Name Address Phone number]
12. If your business is not local, better do not go for local seo. [do not mention location]
13. Use proper outbound links that are do follow, many say that if you give a do follow an outbound link to similar website/blog of others you may lose link juice. That's not true - just imagine the web without links, its bit hard. The whole web is built with links, doing this tells Google that two pages have a similar topic. This is called link sculpting.
14. Try some link building techniques like web directories [only few which have high domain authority and page authoeity] because we can get trust and authority.
15. Try broken link building and etc., which are effective and your competitor cannot get.

How To Cook A Chicken In The Oven?,"There are many ways to cook a chicken in the oven and really, its all down to personal taste which one you prefer. I'll share a few of my personal favourite ways of cooking a chicken in the oven and you can make up your own mind. I like:

• Roasting
• Pot roast
• Casserole
• Biryani

Roasting is the most straightforward way of cooking in the oven and produces golden crispy skin and tender, juicy meat.

• Preheat the oven to 160 (fan), 280F, 140c, gas 3
• Remove the giblets from the cavity of the chicken (if included) and rinse the chicken out with cold running water
• Pat the bird dry and smear the skin with butter, salt and pepper
• For additional flavour, try sprinkling dried thyme over the skin or slicing a lemon and placing slices between the skin and flesh for a great tangy flavour
• I personally place the bird breast side down into the pan (the juices run down into the breast as its cooking, making it extra tasty), but you can put the bird breast side upwards in the pan, its entirely your choice
• Cook for one hour at this low heat and then turn the oven up to 220 (fan), 390F, 200c, gas 7 and cook for a further 30 minutes to go crispy and golden.
• Cover loosely with foil and allow the chicken to rest for 10 minutes for carving

Pot roasting produces a similar juicy, tender meat, but does not brown the chicken in the same way as oven roasting.

• Preheat the oven to 150c, 300F, Gas 2
• Remove the giblets from the cavity (if included) and rinse the chicken well with cold running water
• Pat the bird dry and season inside and outside with salt and pepper
• Heat 2tbsp olive oil with 50g of butter in a large, heavy pot and add the chicken to the pot, turning over and and over to brown the skin all over. Remove from the pot.
• Add 150g of smoked bacon or pancetta and 10 cloves of garlic to the pot until golden.
• Add a generous splash of white wine and add 1kg of peeled, chunked potatoes and toss until covered in the mixture
• Add the chicken to the pot, among the potatoes and add a few sprigs of fresh thyme
• Add 300ml of chicken stock to the pot
• Bring the pan to the boil. Cover the pan and transfer to the oven for 1- 11/2 hours until the potatoes are cooked

Casserole is very similar to pot roast, except you cook the chicken in individual pieces, rather than the bird as a whole. This is my recipe for chicken chasseur

• Preheat the oven to 150c, 300F, Gas 2
• Season your chicken pieces and fry in a large, heavy saucepan until golden brown. Remove from the pan and add one chopped onion and fry until soft. Add 2 crushed garlic cloves and 200g of button mushrooms and cook for 2 - 3 minutes.
• Add 200ml of red wine to the pan and 2tbsp of tomato puree and cook for five minutes until it has reduced slightly.
• Add 3 - 4 thyme sprigs and stir in 500ml of chicken stock
• Add the chicken back to the pan, bring to the boil and simmer on a low heat for around an hour, until the chicken is cooked and tender
• Remove the chicken from the pan and keep warm. Bring the sauce back to the boil and reduce it down quickly for 10-12 minutes until the sauce has thickened slightly and is a rich dark colour.
• For a lower fat option, remove the skin from the chicken before browning

Biryani
This one-pot, rice-based dish is very popular in South Asia and arabian cultures and is really quick and easy to make.

• Wash 300g of basmati rice in water until the water runs clear
• Heat 25g butter in a large pan and fry a sliced onion with a bay leaf, 4 cardamom pods and a piece of cinnamon stick for 10 minutes.
• Add 4 chicken breasts, cut into chunks (or thighs), 1 tsp turmeric and 4tbsp of curry paste (its your choice) to the pan and cook for 5 minutes.
• Add the washed rice to the pan, along with a handful of raisins and 850ml of chicken stock.
• Add a good, tight fitting lid to the pan and bring it to a fast boil. Lower the heat to its lowest and cook for five more minutes.
• Turn off the heat, but leave the pan on the ring for 10 more minutes.
Remove the lid and stir in a handful of chopped coriander and a handful of flaked almonds or unsalted peanuts"

Some of the most obvious questions relate to you and the job, such as:

Why did you decide to apply for this post?

How has your previous work experience qualified you for this position?
How will you ensure that your targets are met?
What are your strengths and weaknesses?
Why should we give you this position?
Where do you see yourself in five years time?
Can you give an example of when you used your initiative in a work environment situation?
What are your salary expectations?
Do you have any questions for us? (Make sure that you do have some, but not too many and not just about salary!)"
,"There can be many types of questions and answers for job interviews. Interrogation is the modus operandi to check your mental level for a job. It is up to the type of job and standard of organization. But in general some of the questions are very common, which are supposed to be asked during job interviews. They use to ask about your introduction, so one should make an impressive introductory speech or whatever.

Another question that is common during job interviews is about your education. You need to be adept on whatever you have studied and whatever your qualification is. They may ask anything from it to test your mind.

They will also ask about your previous experience of jobs, so you should have a summarized paragraph to put forward at that time. Always share the positive points from the past job experiences. Very important thing that comes to the mind of questioner during and interview is that, why the other person is going to leave the old job and applying for this new job. So, you must know that is it a good salary, good environment, good people or which ever the thing may be, which is compelling you to go for this new job."

,"Hi Daniel! Oh yes, they always do and I still do not get it! All I do is play my platform-dashing game: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/electricity-game-dashes-high/id963759829?mt=8 and this is nothing that can harm or bother anyone else! On the other hand, they spend hours watching all sorts of lame sky.com programmes. How is that better than what I do?! I follow the news on Facebook and I know everything that’s happening in the world thanks to mobile internet. It is frustrating as their ignorance urges them to say and believe in unreal things!

Can anyone learn a foreign language?,Yes. You should not expect it to be easy (it’s not) but anyone can learn a second language just like anyone can learn a first language.
,"Hello
there! I am sure that anyone can do so. It is not easy at the beginning, but
once you’ve got a good teacher and you put the time into it, it will be
alright. I remember the time I tried to learn Cantonese. Everything looked like
drawings at first, but after only one month, I was able to read and understand
the language. The main problem for me was the fact that I could not pronounce
the words properly. I suppose that if someone put an hour a day to learn a new
language, it is possible."
,"Hi there! Of course, with the number of specialised software that are out there, it’s very easy for anyone to learn any foreign language that they might be interested in. I have myself managed to learn Hindi, Chinese and Malay using one of these software. Do some research to spot the thing that will suite you best!"
,"Anyone can learn a new language with a bit or maybe more effort. It's important to find suitable methodology to do that and a motivation. This might sound obvious, but if you don’t have a good reason to learn a language, you are less likely to stay motivated over the long-run. Wanting to impress English-speakers with your French is not a very good reason — wanting to get to know a French person in their own language is another matter entirely. No matter your reason, once you’ve decided on a language, it’s crucial to commit.

,"Spam can be defined as irrelevant or unsolicited messages sent over the Internet. These are usually sent to a large number of users for a variety of use cases such as advertising, phishing, spreading malware, etc.
In the past, spam used to favor email as it was the primary communication tool. Email addresses were relatively easy to harvest via chat rooms, websites, customer lists and that impact a user’s address book. Eventually, email filters became more sophisticated, and more effectively decreased spam from clogging the inbox.
Since then, spammers have moved onto a new target: Social applications.
Fake accounts are key to social spamming: To gain credibility, these fake accounts will try to become ‘friends’ or follow verified accounts, e.g., celebrities and public figures with the hope that these accounts befriend or follow them back. When genuine accounts befriend or follow back fake accounts, it legitimizes the account and enables it to carry out spam activities.
Another way for spammers to attack is to hack into and take over a user’s account, spreading fake messages to the user’s authentic followers.

What Are The Causes Of Unemployment In Pakistan?,"There are a number of causes of unemployment in Pakistan.The most important of these causes is a non stop increasing population. Deteriorating law and order situation has slowed down the tempo of economic activity. Karachi is the biggest industrial base of our country. But investors are reluctant to invest there because of continuous unrest and violence.

Our educational system is also responsible for the high unemployment rate among the educated youth. The attitude of our youth towards the choice of a career is also unrealistic and unproductive. They want to get only some white-collar job. Rapid mechanization and computer technology are also causing unemployment.

Unnecessary and frequent strikes in factories have compelled the owners to go for automation and such technology as requires less manpower. Lack of infrastructure facilities, especially in the field of energy, telecommunication and transportation also prevent the industrialist from setting up new industries. Large scale smuggling which has flooded the market with cheaper goods poses a serious threat to the development of local industry.

,"Main problem of unemployment in Pakistan is that whenever a new technology comes as Software or hardware then all the people starts studying about that. Then at the end, you will see ten thousand students of a particular field against 5 or 10 job vacancies.
I remember those days when every one talking about MBA. I have seen many people saying that MBA is good and we will do it.

Actually I am talking about those days when MBA was becoming popular. Many people join MBA even without thinking that there are many other fields, and if everyone does MBA then the competition will also be tough and as a result job will be less but applicants will be thousands times more than that.

Other reason is that in Pakistan, things are not handled in appropriate manner. Vacancies are less, but job seekers are more than that. Opportunities are not enough, and system of reference is so much indulged in our society that if a company need some employees then workers of that company will provide some resume to them of their relatives and friends so in this way many people don't get the opportunity to apply for those jobs. I know system of reference is every where in the world, but not to that extend as in our society.
But as these days software companies are growing and some new companies are starting their business very rapidly so I hope ratio of unemployment will become low soon."

,"I think one important reason of unemployment is the increasing population day by day because Pakistan is a Islamic Country, so their is no concept of Family planing this is against the nature of God, peoples think like this"
,"Unemployment is one of the major problems of Pakistan. The level of unemployment is moving up. The socio economic system of the country and institutions has failed to provide employment to the increasing labour force. The rate of expansion in industrial sector is very slow. The increasing labour force has not been absorbed. Increasing output of general education institutions is the major cause of educated young men's unemployment. Technical, professional and vocational institutions are limited in number.

Nationalization of industrial units very badly affected the investment industrial sector. The private investor shifted their capital to other countries. Employment in the private sector absolutely stopped for many years. The higher growth rate of population is the major causes of unemployment. The population has exceeded the optimum level. The resources of the country are limited.

Employment cannot be provided to the increasing labour force.
The cottage industries in rural areas had been faded out by the machine made goods. The artisans have been rendered unemployed. Educated young men like white collar jobs. They do not like to perform manual labour. The higher age of retirement in government services has blocked the employment of educated young men. Reemployment of civil and military high ranking offices in government corporations and agencies deprives the qualified men from employment."
,"Unemployment is one of the major problems of Pakistan. It is the root cause of several other problems and is a result of a number of problems. High unemployment results in wastage of resources and depression of income. And most certainly it also effects the social and emotional life of a person.

According to a survey, the rate of open unemployment is around 7.5 percent. And this rate is drastically increasing with the passage of time. The unemployment rate is drastically increasing in both rural and urban areas of Pakistan.  In urban areas it is less than in rural areas because there are more industries and more opportunities."
,"Ms.Butt

There are lot of reasons of unemployment in Pakistan, but the most crucial is the minimum wage laws.Young people don,t want to do work on a very low wage.so they remain unemployed.

Poverty is another factor which adds to unemployment. Because unfortunately,corruption has always been at its peak in all big employer's system/institutions in Pakistan. Due to poverty many of our graduates are unable to give a heavy amount for being selected or having an entry into any system."

,"Many issues have contributed towards unemployment in Pakistan. Firstly, the instability of the government and each government deploying it's own people in all major organizations. Bribery leaves little space for educated people with good degrees. Jobs are not offered on the basis of experience and qualification but rather to please higher officials by offering it to their relatives or to  the people they recommend. People with MBA degrees do not want to take just any meagre job, they wait and hope for a better one that suits their educational qualifications. This results in an increase in the unemployment rate.
  Pakistan has the lowest literacy rate in the world. There is a lack of adapting and adopting new technologies that would help companies to grow and newer ones to mushrooM thus creating vacancies.

,"Causes of Unemployment in Pakistan 
The leading problem which the world is facing today is
unemployment. The ratio of unemployment is rising speedily due to lack of
sources and when unemployment takes place so many crimes are automatically be
created. Pakistanis the Asian country has many of problems in these days and
unemployment is one of those. Unemployment is caused numerous problems for its
people. Pakistan has incalculable natural resources but problem is that
resources are being wasted since the independence of Pakistan in 1947. The
people of Pakistan are considered extremely brilliant and hardworking in the
world and there is no significance of talent in Pakistan therefore it is the
reason many of engineers, doctors, Scientifics, technicians and accountants
travel in foreign countries for earn their livelihood.. Due to unemployment the
living standard of Pakistanis is going down with the passage of time. People
are unable to fulfill their basic needs. There are plenty of causes behind
unemployment some of the major causes of unemployment are as fallowing
Lack of Nation
Employment Policy
There has been lack of national employment policy in
Pakistan .so no specific policy was lay dawn to remove unemployment. There have
been no serious efforts at man power paining .due to the lack of the policy the
unemployment problem has reached to its peak.
Slow Growth of
Pakistan Economy
The increase in employment opportunities is intimately  related to growth of economy. Despite that
more than decades of planning the Pakistan economy is going dawn or in law
rate.
Privatization of
Governmental Agencies
One of the major causes of unemployment is also the
privatization of governmental agencies. When the government agency become
private they mostly higher new employees and fire the current employees due to
that many people become unemployed.
Poor Education
System:
The educational system of Pakistan is very poor since 1947.
Unfortunately any government since independence didn’t take remarkable steps to
make the education system good. Education system in Pakistan is uneven. It has
been seen even brilliant students left study due to wrong system. You can many
technical educational colleges and private technical institutions are being
found which are only selling degrees because technical education which is being
given in these institutions has no value, therefore people are wondering about
for jobs due to lack of experience and  skills.
Rapid Growth of
Population:
The rapid growth of population in Pakistan is one of the
most serious issues regarding unemployment. The population of Pakistan is
increasing at very high rate this time. According to the statistical the
population of Pakistan is increasing at the rate of 2.2%. There are many reasons
responsible for overpopulation such as early marriages, illiteracy, desires for
sons, lack of awareness, lack proper family paining etc. As we all know that
theeducation
system of Pakistan is very poor therefore increasing in
population means to bring more uneducated person into the field of labor.
Government or any other company cannot provide jobs or work places to this large
number of uneducated people at time.
Terror Activities:
One of other most serious cause of unemployment in Pakistan
is terrorism. Terrorist activities are on peak at this time in all-around of
Pakistan, therefore situation in Pakistan is really threatening and alarming
and due to this the nationals and as well as foreigners are frightened to
invest in Pakistan. So when investors will not invest so how can job or earning
opportunities are being created?
Arrival of Afghan
refugees
Arrival of afghan refugees to Pakistan is the further
problem of unemployment in Pakistan. These refuges are in Pakistan since 1979
after the attack of Russia due to this many of Afghans migrated to Pakistan for
making them save till the betterment situation of their country and the number
of these refuges increased after American army attacked on Afghanistan in 2001
about 13 years ago and the situation in Afghanistan is still critical. The
migrated people cause of unemployment in Pakistan.
Uncertainty and unrest in the country:
Insecurity and turbulence in
Pakistan and the worsening law and order situation has played a chief role in
transferring the business to other countries, noforeigninvestorsfeel safe and sound in investing in such a country in which their
businesses are not safe In Pakistan due to weak political system and unstable
governmental structure. None of foreign companies want to invest in unrest
environment which become the cause of unemployment in Pakistan
Energy Crisis
There are many sources of
producing of energy in Pakistan but due to lack of proper planning and efforts
Pakistan is having problem of energy crisis. The government of Pakistan is
unable to provide electricity to residential areas in Pakistan than how cansenergy or electricity can be provided to factories and industries.
Therefore factories and industries that are required energy are transferring
their business in other Asian countries like Bangladesh, India and as well as
Sri Lanka. As of this result a huge number of labors are becoming the victims
of unemployment.
Backward Agriculture
The biggest cause of unemployment in Pakistan is the
backwardness of agriculture sector.44% people get jobs from this sector  directly or indirectly unemployment and that
is the biggest sector of economy that contribute 20.9%GPD.there are two main
reason of agricultural backwardness
Adoption of Latest Machinery and capital intensive
technology the demand of labour has been decreased
There is less availability of fertilizers, pesticides,
quality seeds, absences of land reform lack of agriculture education
Absence of merit
system
In Pakistan There is the absence of merit system due
corruption in government and private agencies the people who are well qualified
and skillful remain unemployed.
Favoritism in
politics and lack of plan and management
Favoritism in politics and lack of plan and management has
also given birth to a confusing condition in this regard. The favoritism in
politics has created environment of self- aggrandizement so that everyone is
hit with his own interests to a great extent. Everybody chooses or supports and
seconds the party members of its own for certain posts. That is why a poor even
talented candidate faces joblessness. Moreover, lack of planned management for
the future has been paving the way for the economic scrambles in the country so
that the problem of employment is still unresolved satisfactorily industrialization
deprives the youths from employment"
,"The unemployement is due to high population in Pakistan. The second cause is that because of better machinaries the farmers are not choosing too much workers to work in the farms.
 Third reason - with great improvement in information technology extensive use of computers and fully automatic machines the demand for manual workers has gone down."

,Terrorists have taken all the jobs that is why.
What Are The Causes Of Unemployment In Pakistan?,"There are a number of causes of unemployment in Pakistan.The most important of these causes is a non stop increasing population. Deteriorating law and order situation has slowed down the tempo of economic activity. Karachi is the biggest industrial base of our country. But investors are reluctant to invest there because of continuous unrest and violence.

Our educational system is also responsible for the high unemployment rate among the educated youth. The attitude of our youth towards the choice of a career is also unrealistic and unproductive. They want to get only some white-collar job. Rapid mechanization and computer technology are also causing unemployment.

Unnecessary and frequent strikes in factories have compelled the owners to go for automation and such technology as requires less manpower. Lack of infrastructure facilities, especially in the field of energy, telecommunication and transportation also prevent the industrialist from setting up new industries. Large scale smuggling which has flooded the market with cheaper goods poses a serious threat to the development of local industry. Tight bureaucratic control on the economy, inadequate credit facilities and complex tax system are also some important factors that are creating hurdles in the way of private sector investment in industrial projects."

How To Put My Photo In Google Image Search?,"The answer is simply that you can’t do it specifically.  Google finds images from various websites and adds them to their Image Search, when a relevant key word or phrase is typed in.

If you have posted your photos on a website for example and your name features alongside it on that page somewhere, the pictures may appear in the Google Image Search.  If you really want to do this then you can post your photos on forums, or other websites to try and get Google to add them.  Here is how to do so:

Upload your photos to your computer and name them accordingly.

Work out which websites you want to post them to.  This may be a forum, your own website, a Flickr page, or an image hosting service, such as imageshack.us

If you use an image hosting service, then upload the photo(s), then make sure they are set to a public view, so everyone can see them.  This way Google will be able to add them to their Image Search.

It may take a while before they appear in the Google Image Search.  You can add relevant keywords to the website on which your photo is uploaded to help trigger the search results for that page.  You may want them to be more specific and less common if you want them to appear on the first page of the image results.

Type various relevant keywords into Google to see if your photos have shown up.

If you don’t want anyone to see your photos, perhaps because they are private, copyrighted to you or personal then do not upload them to the internet, as they will then be available for everyone to view and even re-use or edit."

There are three major groups covered by Search Engine Land’s Periodic Table Of SEO Success Factors:
On-the-page SEO
Off-the-page SEO
Violations
Within each group are subgroups, as each chapter of this SEO guide will explain. These subgroups contain one or more individual SEO factors with a specific weight or importance.
Violations, while a group unto themselves, are displayed under the group and subgroup to which they’re associated.
Those two-letter acronyms you see on the chart above? That’s our play on the periodic table of elements and the letter representations, or symbol, of each element. You may have had to remember that the symbol for gold was Au or that iron was Fe.
In the Periodic Table of SEO, we’ve tried to make it slightly more intuitive. The first letter of each “SEO element” comes from the subgroup that it’s in, and the second letter stands for the individual factor.
SEO factors work in combination
No single SEO factor will guarantee search engine rankings. Having a great HTML title won’t help if a page has low-quality content. Having many links won’t help if they are all low in quality. Having several positive factors can increase the odds of success, while the presence of negative factors can worsen those odds.
On-the-page success factors
On-the-page search ranking factors are those that are almost entirely within the publisher’s own control. What type of content do you publish? Are you providing important HTML clues that help search engines (and users) determine relevancy? How does your site architecture help or hinder search engines?
on page SEO tools for free, https://www.prepostseo.com.
Off-the-page success factors
Off-the-page ranking factors are those that publishers do not directly control. Search engines use these because they learned early on that relying on publisher-controlled signals alone didn’t always yield the best results. For instance, some publishers may try to make themselves seem more relevant than they are in reality.
With billions of web pages to sort through, looking only at “on-the-page” clues isn’t enough. More signals are needed to return the best pages for any particular search.
SEO violations & ranking penalties
Make no mistake — search engines want people to perform SEO because it can help improve their search results. Search engines provide help in the form of guidelines, blog posts, and videos to encourage specific SEO techniques.
However, there are some techniques that search engines deem “spam” or “black hat,” which could result in your pages receiving a ranking penalty, or worse, being banned from the search engines entirely.
Violations are general tactics meant to deceive or manipulate a search engine’s understanding of a site’s true relevancy and authority.
A weighting of search ranking factors
All the factors we show are weighted on a scale of 1 to 3, as shown in the top right corner of each factor, as well as reflected in the hue of that factor. A weighting of 3 is most important and is something you should pay special attention to because it has a bigger impact than other factors.
That doesn’t mean that factors weighted 2 or 1 aren’t important; they are. It’s just that they are of less importance, relatively speaking, in terms of the other factors on the chart. Violations are also weighted, but in negative numbers, with -3 being the worst and potentially most harmful to your SEO success.
The weighting is based on a combination of what search engines have said, surveys of the SEO community and our own expertise and experience in watching the space over time. We don’t expect them to be perfect. Not everyone will agree. Your mileage may vary. But we’re confident it is a useful general guide."

There are three major groups covered by Search Engine Land’s Periodic Table Of SEO Success Factors:
On-the-page SEO
Off-the-page SEO
Violations
Within each group are subgroups, as each chapter of this SEO guide will explain. These subgroups contain one or more individual SEO factors with a specific weight or importance.
Violations, while a group unto themselves, are displayed under the group and subgroup to which they’re associated.
Those two-letter acronyms you see on the chart above? That’s our play on the periodic table of elements and the letter representations, or symbol, of each element. You may have had to remember that the symbol for gold was Au or that iron was Fe.
In the Periodic Table of SEO, we’ve tried to make it slightly more intuitive. The first letter of each “SEO element” comes from the subgroup that it’s in, and the second letter stands for the individual factor.
SEO factors work in combination
No single SEO factor will guarantee search engine rankings. Having a great HTML title won’t help if a page has low-quality content. Having many links won’t help if they are all low in quality. Having several positive factors can increase the odds of success, while the presence of negative factors can worsen those odds.
On-the-page success factors
On-the-page search ranking factors are those that are almost entirely within the publisher’s own control. What type of content do you publish? Are you providing important HTML clues that help search engines (and users) determine relevancy? How does your site architecture help or hinder search engines?
on page SEO tools for free, https://www.prepostseo.com.
Off-the-page success factors
Off-the-page ranking factors are those that publishers do not directly control. Search engines use these because they learned early on that relying on publisher-controlled signals alone didn’t always yield the best results. For instance, some publishers may try to make themselves seem more relevant than they are in reality.
With billions of web pages to sort through, looking only at “on-the-page” clues isn’t enough. More signals are needed to return the best pages for any particular search.
SEO violations & ranking penalties
Make no mistake — search engines want people to perform SEO because it can help improve their search results. Search engines provide help in the form of guidelines, blog posts, and videos to encourage specific SEO techniques.
However, there are some techniques that search engines deem “spam” or “black hat,” which could result in your pages receiving a ranking penalty, or worse, being banned from the search engines entirely.
Violations are general tactics meant to deceive or manipulate a search engine’s understanding of a site’s true relevancy and authority.
A weighting of search ranking factors
All the factors we show are weighted on a scale of 1 to 3, as shown in the top right corner of each factor, as well as reflected in the hue of that factor. A weighting of 3 is most important and is something you should pay special attention to because it has a bigger impact than other factors.
That doesn’t mean that factors weighted 2 or 1 aren’t important; they are. It’s just that they are of less importance, relatively speaking, in terms of the other factors on the chart. Violations are also weighted, but in negative numbers, with -3 being the worst and potentially most harmful to your SEO success.
The weighting is based on a combination of what search engines have said, surveys of the SEO community and our own expertise and experience in watching the space over time. We don’t expect them to be perfect. Not everyone will agree. Your mileage may vary. But we’re confident it is a useful general guide."

It's essential that you develop a distinctive social media marketing strategy that mirrors your company's mission and objectives. The voice you create needs to remain consistent across social media channels and through all posts. You can do this by creating your style guidelines and sticking with them. Your online personality needs to be built on consistency and distinct language style. Make sure to set timely (weekly, monthly or yearly) goals and keep track of your achievements.
Schedule Your Posts
Posting once a month is simply not enough to obtain regular visitors and users. It's obvious that no one likes to see a page that hasn't been updated for years. Your audience wants a regular update, and this is what keeps them coming back. Every social media post will increase your engagement with customers, connect with the audience, and build customer loyalty to your brand.
Use #HashTags
Hashtags expose your posts to a wider audience by connecting with people that search the topic. You can decide either to target specific themes with your hashtags or use the ones that are trending to promote your posts. There are many online tools that can help you search for the hashtags that are trending in your niche.
Connect with Influencers
Influencers are people who have mastered the social media marketing through engagement strategies and continue increasing their conversions. Thus, they built the trust and have a large followers base. To gain their attention, all you have to do is mention them in your posts, repost or engage with their content. Choose pages from your industry, local businesses, city, art, events as well as personal connections to build up your network. This will help you define your company's personality by determining how you want to be seen.
Visuals
An image speaks a thousand words. Using images and videos for your posts draws more attention than just plain text. The secret sauce is knowing how to create an image that stands out from the crowd, and implement methods that work. Have the same person posting on your social media to ensure the same style and language that is consistent.
Be Creative
Making your social media campaign a success, you have to be creative.
Brainstorm on innovative and different ideas for posts that will make them stand out. You will quickly notice an increase in your conversion
rate by crafting ideas that boost your social media engagement.

What Are Your Strengths And Weaknesses?,"This is a very common question that many interviewers will ask a potential employee and it is crucial to get it right in order to impress the employer.

When thinking of your strengths, it is always a good idea to try and relate them to the role you may be applying for. If your job involves serving customers then you can say that one of your strengths is having a great rapport with customers and always being polite and helpful - this will obviously be looked upon favorably by the interviewer.

A few more useful strengths to list are as follows:

Great time keeping
Always meet deadlines
Can handle stressful situations and pressure
Smartly dressed
Confident
Willing to learn new skills
Great listener and can take on board any advice
When listing your weaknesses, you need to be very careful and the best strategy is to try and make the weaknesses actually sound positive. You certainly don't want to put a potential employer off by saying you are always late or can be rude and abrupt therefore you need to think long and hard about suitable weaknesses to list.

A few appropriate weaknesses you can list are as follows:

Very eager to get everything finished in one go
Never content with what you've done, always striving for more
Can work 'too hard' and never switch off
Always hard on yourself and wanting to do better
As stated earlier, you need to take care when listing both your strengths and weaknesses and where possible apply these to the job you maybe being interviewed for."

,"My strength is that I have faith,I am determined and I am a hard worker but,my weakness is that am too focused on my work and I need more time too relax and enjoy myself."
,My strength is doing the right thing most of the time meaning just because the world is doing it doesn't mean that I have to be with the world. Another strength is my ambition and tenacity. My weakness is second guessing myself and doing what my second mind sometimes tell me to do.

I Have My Infosys Interview Tomorrow.....what Questions Are Likely To Be Asked In The HR Interview?,"Interviews can be the toughest part of any job. Clearing an interview is a task at any age. Ironically, it is tougher for a HR executive. It puts the future recruiter on the 'hot seat' and he ends up answering questions that he usually asks candidates. As part of the Human Resource team of any company, the candidate is expected to be multi-faceted and very versatile. The HR department of a company handles all the manpower requirement of various operations, skilled and unskilled. It is this department that is primarily responsible for the smooth running of any business.

Some of the commonly asked questions to a HR executive are:
~ What is your philosophy towards your work?
~ List your strengths and shortcomings
~ What feed-back have you got about your work lately?
~ What do you know about this company?
~ Give an example that can be verified, about your ability to work under pressure?
~ Have you ever fired anyone? What were your feelings thereafter?

It is important for you not to sound rehearsed or pompous. The HR Manager interviewing you should be able to see a reflection of himself and his ability to contribute to the company in you. It is very essential to come across as confident and focused."

How Do I Talk About My Biggest Failure In An Interview?,"To talk about your biggest failure in an interview you first must decide, if and when, you have experienced such a failure. Maybe you have never experienced anything you would call a big failure. Depending upon your age, and life experiences, not being aware of a big failure, may be the truth for you. If, this is the case then you need to state this in your interview.

When children grow up in a loving and caring family, a family that is supportive, a family, in which everyone helps everyone else to achieve their goals, big failures do not always happen to them. Even in homes where you are put down for failures this does not mean you are a failure. Failures should be treated as obstacles to overcome not as permanent reminders, to keep you feeling bad about yourself.

If you have never experienced a big failure, just answer this way. I really have never experienced what I would call a big failure. I try to deal with mistakes as learning experiences. If, I fail to reach a goal, I try harder the next time. I am sure I have failed at times, but I do not spend time fretting over these things. I try to focus on doing my best each day, and some days I succeed and some days I do not, but to me it is the effort which counts.

Now, if in fact you have experienced something you believe was a big failure. First state, that while you are aware what happened was a mistake, you learned from the mistake, and that is past history. Today, my focus is looking forward, not backward. I can tell you about my mistake, but I would rather talk about the successes in my life, and who I am at this moment and who I hope to become. I have no problem admitting mistakes, I would be ashamed of my failures, only if, I did not have the intelligence to move beyond them, and strive for higher goals."
,"Do not listen to Jomar... Terrible idea.  Most interviewers don't care what kind of failure you have.  These kind of questions are to see who you are.  If you said what Jomar said for not having any big failure, you will definitely see failure after your interview.  Interviewers want to see how you learned, adapt, and changed from your failure.  Doesn't matter what kind of degree it is, to be honest, they can't tell you if your failure is your biggest or not... So just give anything with a good story."
,"When you are asked about a failure in a
interview, it's important not to describe a failure that can seriously embarrasses
you. Rather, you want to show something where you made a mistake and were able
to overcome it, learn from it, and perform better in the long run.
Then you want to tell a story of a
situation where you made that mistake, how you reacted to it, gathered
information, feedback, advised a plan to correct that mistake, and the steps
you took to correct for it.
Ultimately, what you learned because of
that mistake and how the results were still positive at the end. So, in
thinking about a mistake that you made that you want to tell an interview, look
for that criteria a story that fits that, rather than potentially the largest
mistake of your life."
,"When the interviewer asks about your biggest failure,
Talk about your real life experiences and how come you have faced that failure and what you have learnt from that.
If at all you still not experienced any failure try to expose something which you have seen.
You should speak in such a way that, that is a drastic change in my life and gently i managed and come out of that likewise you should speak.
Failures are the stepping stones of success. Ans you should say as after facing the failure i understood what exactly life mean and now I am  very much clear and strong to face any kind of situation.
Likewise you should be in a position to answer any type of question in the interview. There are some practice online interviews like InterviewBuddy- https://medium.com/@interviewbuddy/how-to-ace-an-interview-the-practical-guide-9a0e7a36425dteam  where you get extreme answers from the industry experts."

Believe in yourself
It can often be difficult to get the self confidence you need when you are under the watchful eye of a potential employer. 
However it is always important to believe in yourself. The employer would not have even called you for an interview if they didn't feel that you have something to offer. Think about your strengths and what you could bring to the company and let that shine through.
Put yourself in the mindset of the employer: What are the things that you'd want to here from a potential employee? What contributions would you want from a potential employee?
Preparation is key
If you do feel nervous at interviews it may help to get extra preparation prior to the interview. The more you prepare for the interview the less nervous you should feel. You could try going through a list of potential questions and thinking about what you might say. 
It may also be helpful to look at the company background and what you could offer them.
Focus on the postives
Try to focus on the positive things that you could personally bring to the company. Do you have any good examples of work experience? 
Perhaps you could mention these examples if relevant and back up your positive attributes and achievements with examples. This will not only impress the employer but will also boost your confidence.
Try not to stress
Attending interviews can be nerve wracking but try not to get too stressed over it. Take a deep, calm breath and try your best. 
At the end of the day if you prepare well, smile and try your best at the interview then you know that you have done everything you can. Ultimately you will land the perfect job for you when you and the employer believes that you are the right fit for the position and it will happen!
I hope this helps to answer your question :)"

,"How to move easily from one para to the next in an essay
 As you know,
Essays are written in paras. First par will be the intro and last will be the
conclusion. The number of body paras has no limit. It depends upon the wideness
of the topic. But the there should be a connection between every para you
write. This can be done in three ways.

  Via a link
sentence at the end of last para: Here, at the end of last para, you write a
sentence that makes the examiner feel what is coming next. Let us say you have
just written a para about the risk caused by AI to jobs. At the ending of that
para you can make a link sentence— “Moreover, we must be aware of the fact that
AI poses a major challenge not just economically, but also morally.” In the coming
para, you can write about the moral issues related to AI. Check for essay writing service
  Through a
question: Other than a link sentence, you can add a question at the end of a
para that can also make the examiner feel what is coming next. To take the same
example as above, the question can be a bit like— “Thus we have seen the threat
posed by AI to our world, but what about the risks brought by AI to our moral
values?” And in the next para, you can write about the moral issues related to
AI.
  Giving a one
word term at the start of next para is the other one.  Here you can add one or two words at the
beginning of a para. It will point a
shift in your subtopic. For instance, after writing a para about its historical
impact in an essay on Globalization, You can begin the next para somewhat like—
“Politically also, globalization has had a huge impact” This way examiner directly
knows what to expect. These steps will ensure that the changes between paras
are not rapid."
How Do I Describe Myself? (when Going For A Job Interview),"Base your self-description around your suitability for the position and focus your presentation around your strengths, relating them to your ability to contribute something invaluable to both your potential employer and their company. Offer examples of your merit wherever possible; everyone enters a interview as a hard-working, responsible and trustworthy individual, and you're not going to stand out a bit from them unless you tell your interviewer exactly why you're deserving of your title. As a final point, try to let your personality shine through. A little genuineness can go a long way.

While it can be difficult to figure out how best to sell yourself to a potential employer, the process becomes a little easier  once you've determined your ultimate selling point. It doesn't have to be something that others have commended you for in the past; rather, figure out what makes you most proud of yourself as a professional.

From there, branch this pride point out as far as you can. What has it meant for your success? What has it taught you? Why is it relevant to the position for which you're applying? Keep adding new items and keep answering the above questions. Go on until you're sick of writing about yourself. Then take a break, put your notebook down, and look it over after a few hours have passed.

With a fresher mind, pick and choose the items that you feel say the most about you while best advertising your suitability. Keep an eye open for unique traits that you express better than most people. You won't want to flood your description with these traits, but one or two should do you well.

Finally, rearrange what you have until you feel confident in your description. Don't focus too much on what you think the interviewer will want to hear. Instead, put together something that allows you to communicate why you are a perfect fit for the job."
,"Always talk about your achievements. Do not talk too much about your family education, as this will be of no relevance. Recommendation is always talk about your projects, if any. Then talk about the situation and how you found a resolution. Make a note of the pointers and then discribe them. This will make interviewee think that you always organise your work well. Ask for sometime to answer questions, as your immediate response may lead you to fall short of words.

,"When you apply for a job, talk abt the relate situation that will help your interviewer to think that they found the right guy. What all you done in past will not of much importance. Talk abt how you will handle a situation. Always go for an interview with a pen and a paper. Ask for sometime before answering. Make headers and then talk abt them. Explain them well."
,"Interview is the very first impression of a person in an organization. We all know that first impression is the last impression. You should give an appropriate introduction in the start of interview. It is better to use English during an interview. You should introduce yourself as a job seeker. You should tell them about yourself by and by. Albeit it will take time but you have to do it in a nutshell. Don't waste a lot of time in telling them useless and irrelevant things about your self. You just need to tell them superficially.
Focus on your achievements in life. Also focus on your educational qualifications and your job experience. Hope you must know how to explore the best part of yours. It is better to talk more but if you think that you are an outspoken person then you should mind talking very less.
One should be careful in facing the interview. It is important to dress decently. You should not look either casual or over-dressed. You should look a gentleman/lady. It is important to make decent shave if you are a guy otherwise you should go for light make-up if you are a female."
,"Tell of any eduction you have in the field.  Tell of any work experience you have in the field.  Tell of general education level.  Tell of any work experience.  Tell why you want the job.  Tell how you would help the company by getting this job.  Tell of any interests or activities you have that are relevant to the job. Tell why hiring you would be a good decision.  Also, when I went on interviews, I always dressed the way I would dress if I got the job and they wanted me to start that day.  Don't dress in a suit if you're going to be working on a farm and don't wear jeans and a T-shirt if you're going to work in an office."
,"The best approach is to tell your real self. Be frank and make sure that your positive traits make a commendable impression to the interviewer. You can also tell about your negative traits but again, be sure of what measures you took/are taking to counter these negative aspect of yours. These should be put in a nice, convincing format so that the interviewer is more impressed at the end."
,"Some people may describe themselves to make themselves sound great but honesty is the best policy !!
You should think about your behaviour and attitude toward life/friends etc. And try to find a word that describes you best.
For example for me it would be thoughtful because I am always thinking."

What rae the things Every Entrepreneur should do before Starting a Business?,"You've concocted an incredible thought for another business.

1. Deal with THE BASICS Business Plan
Maybe a standout amongst other things you can do to enable yourself when you initially to approach setting up another business is to build up a business design. You need to have a reasonable thought of where you are going and how you will arrive, and experiencing the way toward making a business design will constrain you to thoroughly consider all the little points of interest you may somehow or another disregard.
Breakeven Analysis
You'll additionally need to know from the get-go whether your thought will be ready to profit. A breakeven examination will enable you to decide to what extent it will take before you'll have the capacity to turn a benefit. Ensure that you comprehend the substances of maintaining your business ""in the red"": Would you be able to truly sit tight 2-3 years for a benefit?
Subsidizing Sources
Odds are that you wouldn't have the capacity to totally support your business wander alone. Things being what they are, the place is the capital you require going to originate from? A bank? A financial specialist? Family? Ensure that you know the amount you will require and where you will be getting it from.
Showcasing Plan
How are you going to pull in clients to your new business and make them mindful of your quality? What's exceptional and one of a kind about what you will offer, and to whom will you offer it? Know your group of onlookers and how you will transform them into clients.
Leave Strategy
It might appear to be odd to consider how you will leave your business when you're just barely starting to consider beginning it, yet your leave technique may impact how you assemble your business. Is this business going to be a transient wander, or would you say you are anticipating passing it down to your kids? You'll need to make this progress as smooth as conceivable when it comes, so ensure that you are setting up your business in a way that will lawfully take into account this.
2. Concoct A Name
Making sense of your business' name is a more included process than simply drawing up a rundown and picking your top pick; you'll need a name that is anything but difficult to recollect yet one of a sufficiently kind to discover on the web. In the event that potential clients run a web scan for your name, would they say they will locate twelve different businesses, or would they say they will locate your new business? Check with your province assistant or secretary of state to check whether somebody in your general vicinity as of now has a business with your name. Likewise, run a trademark look online to check whether your name is untaken, and check whether your space's name will be accessible for your site.
3. Do Your Due Diligence
How is your business going to be exhausted? What number of proprietors will there be? What will the possession structure be? Is it true that you will require proficient obligation protection, laborer's comp, item risk protection, or business property protection? It is safe to say that you will require a government work recognizable proof number or a merchant's allow for retail products? Shouldn't something be said about neighborhood grants and business licenses? Medicinal services for your representatives? What amount do you have to charge in deals impose? These are the sorts of inquiries you'll need to have the responses to before you open your front entryways. All things considered, ignoring duties, directions, or compulsory licenses can arrive your fresh out of the box new business in a bad position. Keep in mind that you don't have to do this in solitude (and most likely shouldn't!): Counsel a legal advisor, bookkeeper, protection specialist, or kindred business person.
4. Open A Business Bank Account
You might be amazed at the sorts of arrangements you can get when setting up a business financial balance. Make sure to search around and take a gander at something beyond your nearby bank. Contemplate what you'll conceivably require from your new bank. Possibly having portable check store will be urgent for your business, or perhaps you need a boundless number of month to month exchanges. Likewise, recall that you'll likely need some kind of credit/charge card preparing gear or a framework like Square.
5. Make Sense Of The Cost
There's no chance to get around it; opening up another business will be costly. Right now is an ideal opportunity to take a seat and truly consider your financial plan. What amount of will you be spending every month all alone lease/contracts, medical coverage, and bills? Be sensible about what you will and won't have the capacity to relinquish, and leave space for some adaptability. You would prefer not to fall behind on your own costs while additionally attempting to keep your new business above water.

Your new business is likely going to incur significant injury on your own life too. Most new business proprietors work 60-80 hours per week for the initial two years of owning their own particular business. On the off chance that you have enormous occasions coming up in your life (the introduction of a child or a wedding to design, for instance), you might need to sit tight for things to settle down before beginning in on your business too.
6. Decide Your Role
As we said some time recently, it's by and large not prescribed to endeavor to open another business totally all alone. You might be enthusiastic about preparing cakes or offering shirts, however how energetic would you say you are tied in with bookkeeping, managing lawful issues, and dealing with the day by day bothers? Regardless of whether it's contracting workers, expediting a specialist, or getting a bookkeeper, you'll most likely need the assistance of other individuals. It might entice to trust that you'll have the capacity to do this by itself and spare yourself some cash, however blunders in your accounting, an inability to acquire legitimate licenses, or even simply being grouchy and restless with clients since you are so focused can possibly wind up costing you significantly more!
7. Set Up Your Route To Market
How are you going to get your products or administrations to your clients? Will you have a retail facade, or will you offer essentially through Etsy or eBay? In case you're hoping to have a physical area, ensure that you comprehend the area that you're moving into and your potential rivalry. Are the clients that you need to pull in here? Likewise consider how much lease you'll practically have the capacity to bear the cost of and whether the property you're keen on is appropriately zoned for your kind of business and hours.
8. Remain Inspired
Feeling overpowered by every one of that necessities to complete? Pondering whether it's truly justified, despite all the trouble? Now and again all that it takes to get re-roused is to converse with your care group—your family, companions, and so on. Making a stride once again from the little points of interest and helping yourself to remember the 10,000 foot view and the end amusement is vital to do all through the procedure. Keep in mind that all these little irritations you're managing now will help manufacture your business to be far superior.

As yet feeling down? Read about Michael Dell (began Dell Inc. Out of his condominium), Sam Walton (opened his initially store with $5,000 of his funds and a $20,000 credit from his dad; went ahead to establish Walmart), Sara Blakely (started creating Spanx with $5,000 of her own reserve funds, testing her models on her mom and companions), or any of alternate scores of people who began little and went ahead to be the proprietors of massively fruitful organizations. It is conceivable. Who's to state that you aren't next?

Opening a private company won't be simple, and it won't be straightforward, however recall that countless individuals do it consistently. Remain sorted out, and separate the procedure into little advances. Understand this isn't something that will occur without any forethought, and handle one thing at any given moment. It might be a test, yet that will simply make the reward considerably sweeter."
