"Hey, I’m 14 and i would love to start ballet and hopefull start pointe soon, am i too old for it? And how long would it take?","It is never too late to start something you like. As to how long before you can start pointe...It won't happen as quickly as I am sure you would like. Ballet is a lot of work. You really need to get the basics down before advancing to pointe. It will depend on how much work you are willing to put in and how much natural talent you have. I know ballet dancers make it look incredibly easy, but it is hours of hard work and dedication.  I am not saying this to discourage you, but so you know gojng in what to expect. Take a beginner class and focus on that. Give it your heart and soul, and then see how you progress. Good luck!

artists produced amazing albums and singles. Right now I think it might be
Kendrick Lamar’s Humble. I am not a big fan of the rapper, but the lyrics of this
song just blew my mind the first time I heard it. I have been listening to the
single at least once a day ever since it was released."
,Hi! It will have to be Despacito by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee! The song is popular all over the world and most youngsters know the lyrics by heart even if it’s all in Spanish. I also enjoy the remixed version; it features Justin Bieber and it holds some English bits that make it even better!
,How Far I'll Go

What Is The Cure For Urinal Bladder Cancer?,"Is it OK to drink cranberry juice, orange juice, etc. While undergoing BCG treatment for bladder cancer?"
,"While on BCG treatment my husband started to drink black currant juice. I ordered frozen black currants. I filled our Vita-Mix blender a half a way with frozen black currants, one peeled lemon, honey and  little bit of sugar. It makes an amazing cancer fighter drink. He drinks one glass daily.  No signs of cancer has been seen this far.
My father had also a bladder cancer, and this is what he did. It has been 15years since his cancer and he is consider fully healed.

My husband used to drink large quantities of orange juice before his cancer diagnosis.
So he still drinks it, but not that much.  Of cause he used to smoke, too. He is not smoking any more. According his urologist green tea is also an excellent choice."
,"Bladder cancer pertains to any of the various types of malignant growths of the urinary bladder. The bladder is a muscular hollow organ which stores urine in the pelvic region.
Urinary bladder is a disease which manifests by the growth of abnormal cells which multiply without control, in the bladder. Tobacco abuse, exposure to carcinogenic (cancer-causing) compounds like benzidine is responsible for bladder cancers to a vast extent in both the sexes.

The cure for urinary bladder cancer is dependent upon how deep the tumour makes an intrusion into the bladder wall. Tumours which have not yet entered the hollow muscular wall are superficial tumours that can be taken rid off by using an electrocautery device attached to a cystoscope. Immunotherapy in the form of BCG instillation can be used to prevent the superficial tumours from occurring again. Tumours that attack and infiltrate into the bladder have to be operated through ""radical surgery."" In this a significant part or the entire bladder is removed, through a process known as cystectomy. In some cases, qualified surgeons can create a substitute bladder or a neobladder from a part of intestinal tissue."
,"Beside Strarwin's very good answer. Their are natural subtances that will aid in the body fighting the cancer as well. You must include a lot of anti-oxidants into the diet. This means orange,cranberry,grape,raspberry(juice or fruit). Look up something on foods and substance with a large amount of anti-oxidants.
Anti-oxidants is what the cells in our body use to fight cancer causing cells. It makes a big difference in how fast cancer grows the body. It also aids in keeping cancer from reoccuring in treated cases. It also leaves cancer in remission for years even if it is considered terminal. Anti-oxidants helps the body keep cancer cell in check."
,"It is important to think carefully about the best treatment option to be administered. Nevertheless, you will be able to weigh the benefits of different treatment options against the possible side effects and risks.(1)
Some of the treatment options for bladder cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Intravesical therapy
Targeted therapy
Precision medicine
It is also important to have specialized doctors in your team cancer care team before the commencement of any treatment, and these specialists may include are:
Radiation oncologists: Doctors who treat cancer with radiation therapy

What Are Some Advantages And Disadvantages About Fashion?,Fashion takes us away from our monotonous life.
,"The disadvantages of fashion: It costs money to be fashionable.
Here are some. Advantages: Wearing stylish, yet clean-cut tailored clothes can cause others to take you more seriously in the office.  when i join my college gurukul school of design i was thinking it would be very costly to become a fashion designer but afer completing 1 year now its fine. "
,"Here are some. Advantages: Wearing stylish, yet clean-cut tailored clothes can cause others to take you more seriously in the office. Dressing consevatively in a court of law shows respect. Men tent to be liked more by women when they are well groomed. Having a personal style that is unique, yet fashionable can give a person more confidence. Trendily dressed people tend to attract more positive attention. Dressing age appropriately causes people to respect you more. People who are not dressed age appropriately tend to attract scorn and ridicule. Dressing in certain ways can give a woman a more flattering (usually slim hourglass) sillouhette. She can call attention to the parts of herself that she likes (like chiseled abs) and away from those she doesn't (like curvy or flabby thighs). That way, she does not have to feel self conscious. Those who enjoy fashion consider it a form of art. Disadvantages: Among girls and young women, ridiculing each other's outfits and appearances can be a form of bullying. The appearances of the homeless can keep people from offering them jobs. Fashion models tend to be skinny to the extent that it is extremely unhealthy. People may feel uncomfortable physically becayse of peer pressure not to wear a ""dorky"" coat or to wear uncomortable shoes. Fashion can consume money and resources that could be put to uses that help society more. Older children can feel pressured to grow up too fast. 10-year-old girls may want to shave their legs or wear bras. People may support stores that use sweatshop labor because their priority is finding clothes that are ""cute &cheap"" or they think that the clothes from fair-trade stores are ""hippie clothes."" This is not true. Thegreenloop.com and fairiesdance.com ave some really cute clothes that are coop-america (and fashionista) approved. Macy's and H&M have pretty good (although not perfect) track records as to how they treat workers."
,One advantage of fashion is that it makes us happier.

How to be a fashion designer in a young age?,"You learn to sew, and start making your own designs. You wear them and see if your friends will wear them. Then hopefully people will notice and want to buy them. Then you make more and sell them."
,"You do NOT need to know how to sew to be a fashion designer. As a fashion designer, you will be the person who does just that - design clothing. So you will sketch your ideas on paper and then help in choosing the types of fabrics to create them. After this, a pattern maker will create the pattern for your sketch. Then a seamstress will then be the one who will sew it to create what you sketched."
,"Depending on their level of responsibility and the company they work
for, designers may work to their own brief or be given a brief to work
towards, with specifications relating to colour, fabric and budget.

"My stepfather and my favorite little dog, Cupcake were viciously attacked by two huge dogs today. All are alive, but hospitalized. Have you or one of your animals been attacked by a dog?","Omg I'm so sorry!
I hope they both get well soon. I've never been attacked but had a friend once that was.  She had to have many stitches but got ok.
Gosh I'm sorry!
I hope the animal control people picked the dog up."
,"I am so sorry to hear this! Prayers for a speedy recovery for both.
I have never been attacked to the point of being bitten, but there was a dog that lived between my uncle's house and ours that came at me several times when I rode my bicycle past. One time I couldn't out run him and I used my bike as a shield to keep him away. The owner finally came out and called him home. A few days later it went after another child. About a week later, after the cops did nothing, it went after someone who was carrying a gun."
,Tisk. How awful. Must have been a shock.  Hope and wishes for a speedy recovery.
,"Oh my, I'm so sorry to hear this! My dog was attacked by another dog when she was a year old. We were at a campground out of town. I was taking her for a walk when a bigger dog from the camper beside us lunged at her and attacked her. She was bitten around the neck. It was the 4th of July weekend. We found a Vet. In a shabby little office who treated her and said she should stay there a few nights. When I got her back, I immediately took her to my own Vet. Who treated her and she got well with time. Luckily the owner of the other dog took responsibility and paid all the bills."
,"I'm sorry to hear this. I hope your stepfather and dog will be ok. I wish them both a speedy recovery. None of my dogs or myself have ever been attacked. When my dog Sadie and I walk out the top, I'm usually carrying a pistol in case something bad does happen. Fortunately, I've never had to use it."
,"At the dog park my dog was attacked twice . . The first time I called her off defending herself . . . The second time the dog pinned he and I couldn't get there fast enough and she was bit a couple times. When I did get there I pulled her out of harms way and yanked their dog off ROUGHLY by the collar and was ready to kick it if it went back after my dog.
Then I looked at the owner who was apologizing . . . Again . . . And I said ""If you cannot control your dog, you have to go . . . NOW.""
The last couple of times I went back to that park, my dog just stayed under the picnic table I was sitting on to afraid (PTSD) to engage with other dogs . . . It's been a couple years so I may try again."
,
,"My heart goes out to your stepdad, Cupcake, and you.  Praying that all will be well ... And that the offenders will never have the opportunity to attack again."
,"I am so sorry to hear this Dragonfly. ??
My neice when she was a baby got attacked by her uncle's dog. She had to have many stitches close her face. The doctors did a great job. The only scars left looks like she has cute dimples. Oddly when her son was around the same age, he was attacked by a dog as well. His injuries were not as severe. My ex step dad had a dog who drowned my baby kittens. He tried telling me that's the nature of dogs and he was just ""playing"" with the kittens. Pffft yah right. My mom's stupid dog bites Jr's feet when ever one of us tries to talk to her. I just stopped conversing with my mom cuz she blames everything/everyone BUT the dog. And I don't let my son near it anymore.
Funny side story....
One day my husband, kids and I were Pokehunting at a park when a dog approached us rather abruptly. He told it to get away but it wouldnt. He tried talking nice to it and it growled. So he firmly told it to get away again and it became more aggressive back so he grabbed one of the kids scooters to scare it off and it growled but backed off. We watched it to make sure it left but it wouldn't leave! It kept trying to approach us. My husband was like ""DANG he's persistant!"" My husband said maybe we are blocking his way to his home or something so we went around the other way to get to our car. (I had enough excitement for the night! Lol!) Anyways sure enough where we were originally standing the dog ran back there and as the kids were getting in the car, this dog trotted past us with a bone in its mouth! He was just wanting his bone he buried earlier! ?? So we praised him a good dog! ??"
,"I m so sorry. I know how you love your dog bcuz I love my cats the same way. Your dog is your baby and a part of your heart. 
Once I remember one I was out for a walk when this dog had gotten away from his chain and came at me. He didn't bite but he growled and showed his teeth. I never walked that way again.
Another time a woman came to our home and let her pit bull out of the car. He came at my cat and actually tried to kill him. It took 3 ppl to get that dog off.                                      My husband threatened to kill the dog. She left in such a hurry, she hit a car on the way out, and that delayed her even longer.              My kitty went to the vet and was ok. The dog just wrenched his jaw."
,my friend got bit in the butt by a dog he’s ok it was pretty funny and sorry about what happened

How Can Learning About Psychology Improve Your Everyday Life?,"Psychology is often mistakenly thought to be a highly academic subject, or something only of concern to those who are 'mentally ill'. In fact, psychology is also a practical subject, and the results of academic psychological studies can be applied to everyday life.

Here are a number of ways in which psychology can improve our everyday lives:

Improve Your Motivation
Academic research has given us a wealth of information about what motivates us, and how we can manage our own motivation. The work of academics has been distilled into bite-size pieces of advice that we can use in our daily lives.

Improve Your Communication Skills
It's commonly accepted that non-verbal signals account for a great deal of the meaning we decode during face-to-face conversations. Learning how to read another person's body language is fundamental to ensuring that you convey your meaning effectively to them.

Developing awareness of your own body language will also help you to ensure that your communication is not misread by others.

Make Better Decisions
Understanding what motivates our desires - and what we actually want to get out of life - helps us to make better decisions. Rather than relying upon snap decisions, psychology provides us with tools that we can use to analyse the value we obtain from certain outcomes, and enables us to make judgements that increase the possibility of these outcomes being realised.

Building a Better Memory
Again, academic research has helped our understanding of how memory works, and what techniques we can practice daily in order to improve it. By looking at how we process information when we receive it, we can make sure that memories are stored more effectively."
,"Psychology helps us to understand people's inner feelings by reading their body language and appearance. It teaches us how to treat people the right way. But sometimes it is easy to go overboard with your analysis of people and scare them away, if you're not careful."
,you  could read books on psychology.
What kind of vacation do you enjoy?,I often enjoyed the vacations on beaches. SEO companies in Canada
,I like visiting places I haven't been before.
,some place where there is no anxiety.
,"Hey there. For me it is a week or two at a hotel with the
ones I love. I usually go out with my mother and girlfriend for a few weeks and
enjoy my time without any stress. If it’s not a hotel, it will be a villa or a
bungalow. But, it is normally somewhere pleasant and away from home."
,I always enjoy car driviing and visit some distance plaaces with my family. I have just bought a very good car seat for infants for my little daughter and we plan to visit canyon in a couple of weeks

Is it good for cats to play with toys? Why/why not?,Its good for cats to play with toys. It keeps their mind active and gives them confidence too.
,Sure. That's why they make them. Toys keep them amused.
,its always bad for them :D
,if they enjoy it yes it can be good and fun for them.
,Cats are vermin. Give them toys to play with if you wish to waste your money and their (limited) mental abilities. They will be out killing birds and rodents soon afterwards. Then they will be digging up neighbouring gardens to take a dump. Hateful animals in every way.

The last couple of times I went back to that park, my dog just stayed under the picnic table I was sitting on to afraid (PTSD) to engage with other dogs . . . It's been a couple years so I may try again."

My neice when she was a baby got attacked by her uncle's dog. She had to have many stitches close her face. The doctors did a great job. The only scars left looks like she has cute dimples. Oddly when her son was around the same age, he was attacked by a dog as well. His injuries were not as severe. My ex step dad had a dog who drowned my baby kittens. He tried telling me that's the nature of dogs and he was just ""playing"" with the kittens. Pffft yah right. My mom's stupid dog bites Jr's feet when ever one of us tries to talk to her. I just stopped conversing with my mom cuz she blames everything/everyone BUT the dog. And I don't let my son near it anymore.
Funny side story....
One day my husband, kids and I were Pokehunting at a park when a dog approached us rather abruptly. He told it to get away but it wouldnt. He tried talking nice to it and it growled. So he firmly told it to get away again and it became more aggressive back so he grabbed one of the kids scooters to scare it off and it growled but backed off. We watched it to make sure it left but it wouldn't leave! It kept trying to approach us. My husband was like ""DANG he's persistant!"" My husband said maybe we are blocking his way to his home or something so we went around the other way to get to our car. (I had enough excitement for the night! Lol!) Anyways sure enough where we were originally standing the dog ran back there and as the kids were getting in the car, this dog trotted past us with a bone in its mouth! He was just wanting his bone he buried earlier! ?? So we praised him a good dog! ??"
,"I m so sorry. I know how you love your dog bcuz I love my cats the same way. Your dog is your baby and a part of your heart. 
Once I remember one I was out for a walk when this dog had gotten away from his chain and came at me. He didn't bite but he growled and showed his teeth. I never walked that way again.
Another time a woman came to our home and let her pit bull out of the car. He came at my cat and actually tried to kill him. It took 3 ppl to get that dog off.                                      My husband threatened to kill the dog. She left in such a hurry, she hit a car on the way out, and that delayed her even longer.              My kitty went to the vet and was ok. The dog just wrenched his jaw."
,my friend got bit in the butt by a dog he’s ok it was pretty funny and sorry about what happened
im crying right now? i lost this group of close friends even though i apologize countless of times but they feel very awkward? i really don't feel the point of living? please be kind. i been crying for hours,"well first of all...stop crying...
secondly....as you said that u apologized countless of times then theres no need to feel sad. They DONT DESERVE YOU. Even tho thye might be better looking  , popular, A-graders , whatever....you dont need them.
when life hits you with such things, learn that everything happens for a reason and who knows, your good lies in staying away from them?
so i know its hard,,but easy to say , but this is the most i can say right now.
now here comes two choices..
1.Do you want to stay in depression and sadness just cos of a couple of ""people"" who dont want to be your ""close"" friend anymore?
2.Or do you want to calm down, get life sorted, your priorities sorted, shake it off and move on and go on to find better people ?
so there you go, its totally on you...now cheer up and make the right choice! :)"

What is a real friend?,"https://www.jw.org/en/bible-teachings/teenagers/whiteboard-animations/whats-a-real-friend/
This is a really good video that I have shared with so many, no matter what their age. There is  proverb that says: "" There exists a friend who sticks closer than a brother"". A true friend will be there for you through thick and thin. Good or bad. A true friend tells you the truth even when you don't want to hear it. Hope this video is helpful  to you"
,A good friend may not talk to you all the time and may not be closest by distance.. But drops everything when you need them.. They’ll always lift you up not matter what
,The real friend is that. Which works in trouble.
,"I don't know, never had one :P"
,"ANONYMOUS.........FAKE FRIENDS ARE EASY TO COME BY, BUT HOW CAN YOU FIND A TRUE FRIEND?
MAKING FRIENDS IS NOT ALWAYS EASY WHEN YOU ARE YOUNG OR UP IN AGE.  MOST PEOPLE FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE GOOD FRIENDS.  WHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR IN A FRIEND?  WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO HAVE A LASTING FRIENDSHIP?  BUT, THE QUESTION IS HOW CAN YOU BE A GOOD FRIEND?
CONSIDER:   
1.    SHOW THAT YOU REALLY CARE
TRUE FRIENDSHIP INVOLVES COMMITMENT.  IN OTHER WORDS, A GOOD FRIEND FEELS A RESPONSIBILITY TOWARD YOU AND HE REALLY CARES ABOUT YOU.  OF COURSE, SUCH COMMITMENT IS TWO-WAY, AND IT REQUIRES HARD WORK AND SACRIFICE ON BOTH SIDES.    REMEMBER, TO HAVE A GOOD FRIEND, YOU FIRST NEED TO BE A GOOD FRIEND.
2.    WHAT PEOPLE LOOK FOR IN A FRIEND
START BY WANTING TO BE A GOOD FRIEND YOURSELF.  BE GENEROUS IN SHOWING AFFECTION AND PERSONAL INTEREST.  AND BE WILLING TO SACRIFICE YOUR TIME WHEN YOU ARE NEEDED.
THE BIBLE TELLS US:  ""JUST AS YOU WANT MEN TO DO TO YOU,  DO THE SAME WAY TO THEM.  PRACTICE GIVING, AND PEOPLE WILL GIVE TO YOU"".  (LUKE 6:31, 38)
3.    BE A GOOD COMMUNICATOR
A TRUE FRIENDSHIP CANNOT FLOURISH WITHOUT REGULAR COMMUNICATION.  SO TALK TOGETHER ABOUT THE INTERESTS YOU SHARE.  LISTEN TO WHAT YOUR FRIEND HAS TO SAY,  AND RESPECT HIS OPINIONS.  WHENEVER POSSIBLE, COMMEND AND ENCOURAGE HIM.
4.    HAVE REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS
THE CLOSER WE GET TO A FRIEND, THE MORE LIKELY WE ARE TO SEE HIS FLAWS.  OUR FRIENDS ARE NOT PERFECT, BUT NEITHER ARE WE.  THEREFORE, WE SHOULD NEVER EXPECT OR DEMAND PERFECTION FROM THE PEOPLE WE BEFRIEND.  RATHER, IT IS GOOD TO CHERISH THEIR VIRTUES AND TO MAKE ALLOWANCES FOR THEIR  MISTAKES.
5.    WIDEN YOUR CIRCLE OF FRIENDS
IT'S TRUE WE NEED TO BE SELECTIVE ABOUT THE PEOPLE WE BEFRIEND.  BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN NARROWING OUR CHOICE OF FRIENDS TO THOSE OF A CERTAIN AGE OR UPBRINGING.  TAKE AN INTEREST IN PEOPLE OF ALL AGES, CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS, AND NATIONALITIES CAN TRULY ENRICH OUR LIVES.
WHEN YOU WIDEN YOUR FRIENDS IT GIVES YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO MATURE AS A PERSON.  WHEN YOU LEARN TO GET ALONG WITH PEOPLE OF ALL AGES THAT WILL MAKE YOU MORE OUTGOING AND ADAPTABLE.
LASTLY;    ACCEPT THE FACT THAT YOUR FRIENDS WILL MAKE MISTAKES.  WHEN PROBLEMS ARISE, WE DO WELL TO RESOLVE THEM QUICKLY AND TRY HARD TO FORGET."
,"Hello! A real friend is someone whom you can count on
whenever you really need help. He/she is that person who will tell you without
any fear about your wrongdoings and prevent you from falling down in the abyss.
A true friend is a person just like your mother, who cares for you and with
whom you can have a good time."

I have a funny bird joke for you all!
So this guy breaks into a house and as he is rummaging through drawers he hears a voice say ""Jesus is watching you."" It startled the man and he flashed his flash light around. Didn't see anything so he kept going. He hears the voice again ""Jesus is watching you."" The guy looks again with his light and sees a bird. ""Oh it's just a bird"" the robber said. Then he said to the bird ""what's your name pretty bird?"" The bird replied ""Moses."" The robber laughs and says ""MOSES! Thats a funny name for a bird! Who the heck would name their bird Moses!?!"" And the bird replied ""the same kind of people who name their pit bull Jesus!"""

I hope they both get well soon. I've never been attacked but had a friend once that was.  She had to have many stitches but got ok.
Gosh I'm sorry!
I hope the animal control people picked the dog up."
,"I am so sorry to hear this! Prayers for a speedy recovery for both.
I have never been attacked to the point of being bitten, but there was a dog that lived between my uncle's house and ours that came at me several times when I rode my bicycle past. One time I couldn't out run him and I used my bike as a shield to keep him away. The owner finally came out and called him home. A few days later it went after another child. About a week later, after the cops did nothing, it went after someone who was carrying a gun."

I was taking her for a walk when a bigger dog from the camper beside us lunged at her and attacked her. She was bitten around the neck. It was the 4th of July weekend. We found a Vet. In a shabby little office who treated her and said she should stay there a few nights. When I got her back, I immediately took her to my own Vet. Who treated her and she got well with time. Luckily the owner of the other dog took responsibility and paid all the bills."

My neice when she was a baby got attacked by her uncle's dog. She had to have many stitches close her face. The doctors did a great job. The only scars left looks like she has cute dimples. Oddly when her son was around the same age, he was attacked by a dog as well. His injuries were not as severe. My ex step dad had a dog who drowned my baby kittens. He tried telling me that's the nature of dogs and he was just ""playing"" with the kittens. Pffft yah right. My mom's stupid dog bites Jr's feet when ever one of us tries to talk to her. I just stopped conversing with my mom cuz she blames everything/everyone BUT the dog. And I don't let my son near it anymore.
Funny side story....
One day my husband, kids and I were Pokehunting at a park when a dog approached us rather abruptly. He told it to get away but it wouldnt. He tried talking nice to it and it growled. So he firmly told it to get away again and it became more aggressive back so he grabbed one of the kids scooters to scare it off and it growled but backed off. We watched it to make sure it left but it wouldn't leave! It kept trying to approach us. My husband was like ""DANG he's persistant!"" My husband said maybe we are blocking his way to his home or something so we went around the other way to get to our car. (I had enough excitement for the night! Lol!) Anyways sure enough where we were originally standing the dog ran back there and as the kids were getting in the car, this dog trotted past us with a bone in its mouth! He was just wanting his bone he buried earlier! ?? So we praised him a good dog! ??"
,"I m so sorry. I know how you love your dog bcuz I love my cats the same way. Your dog is your baby and a part of your heart.

Another time a woman came to our home and let her pit bull out of the car. He came at my cat and actually tried to kill him. It took 3 ppl to get that dog off.                                      My husband threatened to kill the dog. She left in such a hurry, she hit a car on the way out, and that delayed her even longer.              My kitty went to the vet and was ok.

What is the best way to remove wrinkles naturally?,"These are some of my suggestions: Keep your skin correctly hydrated, avoid stress and sun, make sure to take vitamin D.  "
,"Wrinkles are part of our natural process of aging and each one of us is going to have them sooner or later. This doesn't mean we cannot reduce them as much as possible as they can be unpleasant to see.
Wrinkles depend on a lot of factors: Your DNA, your skin's elasticity, personal attitude (if you're constantly stressed, for example), what you eat and drink, and especially what you do to take care of your skin.
When trying to remove or at least diminish wrinkles, it is better to choose a treatment that it as natural as possible, because if you start using products that contain chemicals, they will actually be harmful to your skin. Opt for natural products instead, you could also make your own mask at home with ingrendients like honey, aloe vera olive oil, lemon, cucumber, bananas and avocados.
Coconut oil works well too, I suggest to ask suggestion in a shop you trust because it also depends on the kind of skin you have. Here is a link to some recipes of masks you could do at home with a few ingredients.
As well as taking care of your outer body, take care of your inner one. Pay attention to the foods you eat, avoiding processed foods and alcohol, avoid smoking (among other things, it causes early aging) and drink loads of water.
Use sunscreen to protect your face and body from the damaging effect sunrays can have on your skin not only when you go to the beach but also in your daily life especially in the areas that get more exposed (like your face and neckline, arms and so on).
Get enough sleep and also pay attention to how you sleep.
To avoid wrinkles on your face you should ideally sleep on your back to avoid ""sleep lines"" that might become permanent.
Also, if you have a bigger budget you can include some massages into your routine. You could do them by yourself but maybe an expert knows exactly the spots to target and they way to go.
Hope this helps!"
,Wrinkles are to humans what rings are to trees: They're they're Mother Nature's way of marking the passing years. Better than trying to camouflage them might be learning to wear them with pride.
,Don't tan and stay out of the sun.
,Natural olive oil can help your skin stay soft and supple. Gently massage a few drops on your face before bedtime and rinse with a soft towel. You’ll wake to skin that’s soft and healthy looking.
,"Here are top home remedies which could help you slow down the appearance of wrinkles as well as maintain a nice and smooth skin.
1. Aloe vera
Take an Aloe Vera leaf and extract the gel.
Mix a teaspoon of the gel with the oil from vitamin E capsules.
Apply this mixture on your skin about 30 minutes.
Cleanse by warm water.
2. Olive oil
Mix  olive oil with honey and glycerin.
Massage your skin twice per day with this mixture.
3. Fenugreek
Grind some fresh leaves to make a paste.
Apply this paste on your skin and keep it overnight.
After waking up, wash by warm water.

,"1. Sunscreen: The amount of melanin produced is affected by level of exposure to sunlight. Dermatologists recommend regular use of sunscreens having SPF 30 and above to get rid of pigmentation. Such productsblock more than 90% of the sun’s harmful rays (UVA + UVB).
2. Water: Drink lots of water, at least 3–4 liters daily. Water keeps skin hydrated and remove all kinds of impurities that tend to become clogged inside pores.
3. Peeling: A natural home remedy, peels encourage production of new cells by exfoliating damaged or dead superficial skin. It restores youthful and refreshing look to skin.
4. Vitamin E: There is a reason why vitamin E is often referred to as beauty vitamin. It is an antioxidant that helps neutralizes the harmful UV rays of the sun and repairs damaged skin.
5. Aloe vera: This plant is an excellent cure for hyperpigmented skin. The slimy substance in aloe vera, mucilaginous polysaccharides, is good at removing dead skin cells and promoting skin regeneration.

Can Toxic Mold Cause Hives And Rashes?,"carlpenergy

Yes, most definitely.
Many people who live, or have lived, in toxic mold-infested homes report severe rashes and hives appearing on their bodies, many overnight. Toxic mold is extremely contagious and extremely dangerous and can even be deadly, especially amongst children and the elderly and infirm. The mold is particularly prevalent in homes that are susceptible to damp and those where the wall lining is non-porous, denying it of oxygen, thus giving the wall no opportunity to breath. Toxic mold, or stachbybotrys chartarum to give it its scientific name, occurs when water damage, excessive humidity, water leaks, condensation or flooding is present.
Treatment of mold allergy hives varies on the severity of the complaint. You could try over the counter medicines that are available at chemists and drugstores, or antihistamines that can be taken to treat symptoms such as hives and rashes. Soothing creams can be used to reduce the itchiness of the hives but, in more serious cases, steroids will be prescribed by your doctor, however these can have side effects.
If you believe toxic mold is present in your home, a thorough home inspection will be able to uncover the dangerous mold form, which should be professionally treated. Toxic molds produce chemicals called mycotoxins that not only cause hives and rashes, but can also bring on seizures, respiratory problems, unusual bleeding and severe fatigue. Toxic mold will only grow on wood, paper and cotton products, but a mold-infested home can become a lethal environment for those prone to allergy problems. Once black mold begins to fester in a home, spores are released by the mold clusters. These microscopic cells quickly become airborne and travel through air conditioning and heating systems. In many cases the only solution to the problem is to demolish the building and rebuild."
,"I moved into a older home in 2009 november. Over the course over the next two months I stared to develop what I thought was a rash. Turns out they were hives. Seen allergists, Immunoligist, primary care, multiple ER visits. The hives affected my breathing also. Even made me emmotionally distressed. I had delt with chronic uticaria for almost seven months.I was on at one time, Zantac 150 twice a day, hydroxyzine 10mg 8 times a day, allegra once a day and, advaire twice daily. Was allergy tested, blood tested from multiple doctors. Stoped from eating, wheat, fish, eggs, milk. I was told they may only be able to treat the symptoms. My kids started getting sick also. No hives just respitory symptoms. I decidede to move to my parents home which was near by to see if somthing in the house was an issue. This house had mold. I worked in the construction field and was remodling this dream home. Two weeks out of this house and not a single hive. I am currently down to one zantac 150 once before bed. It took a little time for the hives to stop completel, I have none now. Just as a test went back to the house to put in a couple of Large HEPA filters to see if I could make the house livable. 8 hours after I went to the house hives started showing up again. Hope this helps. I looked at several forums out of desparation. I believe that mold caused this. Definitly something in the house."
,"I have had hives since 2001. The home I was living in had toxic mold. When we decided to buy the home that we were leasing, we had an inspection done. The inspector found mold. Then we had a mold inspection. It was determined that there was toxic mold in the house. The mold was on the back of the dry wall about 1'' thick. My husband developed COPD and died. I was put on Diflucan, which worked for 5 years. The doctors told me that there is no way to get rid of this type of infection, and that the infection would eventually become resistant to Diflucan, which is what happened after 5 years. My health insurance was cancelled when the diagnosis came back in 2002. This year I have health insurance, but the new doctors took me off the Diflucan, so now I am covered in hives again. They are giving me drugs to suppress the hives, which worked for a few months. Even after fungus became resistant , the Diflucan still suppressed more hives than Hydroxyzine and Fexofenadine HCl that my current doctors subscribed.

The first group of doctors ran a fungal panel, that registered how many antibodies for each of 500 fungi where in my blood. About 4 fungi had 3 to 5 times the amount of antibodies normally found in blood, so that is why they decided to try Diflucan. They were going to send me to Rheumatoid Arthritis specialist, until we discovered the toxic mold in our home. The new doctors say that there is no way to test for fungus, and the presence of antibodies does not mean that there is an active infection.

I thought I had arthritis before I was put on the Diflucan, and I was also having some nerve problems. I would fall and drop things because I would momentarily loose control of nerves in my arms or legs. All those problems went away while I was on Diflucan. Now the nerve problems are slowly coming back, but so far adding golden flax, fish oil, primrose oil, walnuts, and olives to my diet has helped with most of the joint pain.

The other day I went to see two naturopaths who are in to herbs. One graduated from UC Irvine and the other received his training at Trinity. I am unfamiliar with this discipline, but they did offer a solution. It would cost $200 to $250 for 3 to 6 months and then $50 a month to control the condition after that. They claimed that the fungus would not become resistant to this treatment.

I currently had lost my full time job and I am only working part time, so I don't have the money to pursue this course of action at the moment. I have started looking to alternative medicine since doctors belonging the AMA don't seem to be able to help me, and sometimes the hives are so bad that they leave bruises, not to mention that they are all over my body. The good news is that the hives that are on parts of my body that are exposed to sun light go away till the sun goes down. So I look normal during daylight hours.

My advice is to get away from any possible source of toxic mold. And if you find a solution please post it. I am told that 5% of the population suffers from chronic hives and the medical profession has been unable to find a cause. Untreated the itching from hives can just about drive one insane, so I am definitely looking for a solution. I have also begun to wonder if fungus might be the cause of some of the autoimmune diseases, since some of my symptoms mimic some of those diseases. I wish you the best of luck at putting an end to your chronic hives."
,"To the person who posted :
Me and my partner moved into our house about 4 months ago, we had noticed that their was a mold build up in the corner of the dining room directly under our bathroom. We thought nothing of it at first as the house is rented so eventualy it would be dealt with by the landlord. However my partner has been breaking out in severe hives but I don't, could it be the mold that is causing her outbreaks, even though I'm not affected by it?

The answer to that is yes. About 4 years ago me my partner moved into a really nice townhome, and all was great. The first night there I took a shower and the water 'stung' which had never happened before, I didnt think much of it, I mean it was weird but I figured I was just sore from working out. WHen I went downstairs I found a leak had happened while I was in the shower and water was everywhere...after cleaning it up, my hands burned and that was about the time when I realized something was wrong with the water, and told myself to call my landlord in the morning. Long story short...I came down with sever hives, face swelling, hand swelling, leg/feet swelling...and covered in hives. Our landlord refused to believe anything was wrong, and kept putting it off until I finally busted part of the ceiling off and exposed a HUGE mess of toxic black mold.
My advice to you is, if your girlfriend is having hives and or trouble breathing, its time to call your landlord and do something. My partner had lung problems for years after we moved out of that place. Just because you show no physical signs like your girlfriend (IF it is mold that she is allergic to) does not mean that you are safe from whatever is affecting her. I wish you guys the best of luck."
,"To the individual that is on Diflucan , a friend of mine had a fungal infection in her lungs.  She went to a health food store and she was told to take Vitamin B-15.  She said that it worked and she has not had a problem since.

It's worth a try."
,"Mold is a fungus and toxic mold refers to molds that produce mycotoxins, such as Stachybotrys chartarum. The answer to your question is yes. Toxic mold can cause hives and rashes. You should see your doctor for proper treatment."
,"Yes, were having an outbreak from an old piece of furniture that was contaminated. It's a long story, but my brother has a nasty hive like rash from head to toe. Now I'm starting to itch. Here's the game plan. Bleach all clothes. Lysol carpets furniture. And most important, the nuclear option. An Ozone Generator. I'd never heard of such a thing. It took a while to actually find a place that rents them. Ozone is the one thing that kills mold dead. When you use it, no plants or pets can be around. You can't be in the room when it's running. Do some research on it and you will see what I'm talking about. Hope this helps and good luck  "
,"It can MOST definitely give you hives and rashes - I lived for 7 months on prednisone because the doctors couldnt figure out why I was getting hives 24/7 -to the point that I was in the E.R. Every other week- I was unrecognizable because of the hives. It can get really ugly - really quick!! I was renting a townhome in Irvine, CA - they had water damage -which they said was little and they dryed out quickly- well a little more investigation there was toxic black mold in the master bathroom(in the walls,under the cabinet)! Really look around - the docs can't do as much as you when it comes to this!!! MOVE OUT! I'm still dealing with hives (they are a lot better -and go away on there own )so thats a plus. But once you move out -do a whole body cleanse... And keep pushing for them to give you an antifungal to kill the mold in your body!  

Good luck -I know how it feels!"
,"I left a basket out in the porch and it had gotten wet in the rain. After a couple of days it had grown mold all over the inside of it. I picked it up and immediately threw it in the trash. The next morning I woke up with my entire body covered with hives. The next day it had gotten worse and my face had them too. I went to the doctor yesterday and he prescribed me Prednisone and said that it should work. We'll see......but yes, I would say that mold definitely causes hives and rashes!"

I started experiencing hives all over my body and severe facial swelling literally overnight and it has continued to happen 3 different occasions. The only thing that has changed in our lives is the fact that we moved to this apartment that is built in the side of a mtn. We do know we have mold in the bathroom, but I believe we have mold in between our wood paneling and the concrete walls our house is built with. Reading the answers on here have really helped but I'm so terrified that I'm calling our landlord and demanding a mold test right away."

My neice when she was a baby got attacked by her uncle's dog. She had to have many stitches close her face. The doctors did a great job. The only scars left looks like she has cute dimples.

He tried telling me that's the nature of dogs and he was just ""playing"" with the kittens. Pffft yah right. My mom's stupid dog bites Jr's feet when ever one of us tries to talk to her.

Funny side story....
One day my husband, kids and I were Pokehunting at a park when a dog approached us rather abruptly. He told it to get away but it wouldnt. He tried talking nice to it and it growled. So he firmly told it to get away again and it became more aggressive back so he grabbed one of the kids scooters to scare it off and it growled but backed off. We watched it to make sure it left but it wouldn't leave! It kept trying to approach us. My husband was like ""DANG he's persistant!"" My husband said maybe we are blocking his way to his home or something so we went around the other way to get to our car. (I had enough excitement for the night! Lol!) Anyways sure enough where we were originally standing the dog ran back there and as the kids were getting in the car, this dog trotted past us with a bone in its mouth! He was just wanting his bone he buried earlier! ?? So we praised him a good dog! ??"

,"Oh my, I'm so sorry to hear this! My dog was attacked by another dog when she was a year old. We were at a campground out of town. I was taking her for a walk when a bigger dog from the camper beside us lunged at her and attacked her. She was bitten around the neck. It was the 4th of July weekend. We found a Vet. In a shabby little office who treated her and said she should stay there a few nights. When I got her back, I immediately took her to my own Vet. Who treated her and she got well with time. Luckily the owner of the other dog took responsibility and paid all the bills."
,"I'm sorry to hear this. I hope your stepfather and dog will be ok. I wish them both a speedy recovery. None of my dogs or myself have ever been attacked. When my dog Sadie and I walk out the top, I'm usually carrying a pistol in case something bad does happen. Fortunately, I've never had to use it."
,"At the dog park my dog was attacked twice . . The first time I called her off defending herself . . . The second time the dog pinned he and I couldn't get there fast enough and she was bit a couple times. When I did get there I pulled her out of harms way and yanked their dog off ROUGHLY by the collar and was ready to kick it if it went back after my dog.
Then I looked at the owner who was apologizing . . . Again . . . And I said ""If you cannot control your dog, you have to go . . . NOW.""
The last couple of times I went back to that park, my dog just stayed under the picnic table I was sitting on to afraid (PTSD) to engage with other dogs . . . It's been a couple years so I may try again."

My neice when she was a baby got attacked by her uncle's dog. She had to have many stitches close her face. The doctors did a great job. The only scars left looks like she has cute dimples. Oddly when her son was around the same age, he was attacked by a dog as well. His injuries were not as severe. My ex step dad had a dog who drowned my baby kittens. He tried telling me that's the nature of dogs and he was just ""playing"" with the kittens. Pffft yah right. My mom's stupid dog bites Jr's feet when ever one of us tries to talk to her. I just stopped conversing with my mom cuz she blames everything/everyone BUT the dog. And I don't let my son near it anymore.
Funny side story....
One day my husband, kids and I were Pokehunting at a park when a dog approached us rather abruptly. He told it to get away but it wouldnt. He tried talking nice to it and it growled. So he firmly told it to get away again and it became more aggressive back so he grabbed one of the kids scooters to scare it off and it growled but backed off. We watched it to make sure it left but it wouldn't leave! It kept trying to approach us. My husband was like ""DANG he's persistant!"" My husband said maybe we are blocking his way to his home or something so we went around the other way to get to our car. (I had enough excitement for the night! Lol!) Anyways sure enough where we were originally standing the dog ran back there and as the kids were getting in the car, this dog trotted past us with a bone in its mouth! He was just wanting his bone he buried earlier! ?? So we praised him a good dog! ??"
,"I m so sorry. I know how you love your dog bcuz I love my cats the same way. Your dog is your baby and a part of your heart. 
Once I remember one I was out for a walk when this dog had gotten away from his chain and came at me. He didn't bite but he growled and showed his teeth. I never walked that way again.
Another time a woman came to our home and let her pit bull out of the car. He came at my cat and actually tried to kill him. It took 3 ppl to get that dog off.                                      My husband threatened to kill the dog. She left in such a hurry, she hit a car on the way out, and that delayed her even longer.              My kitty went to the vet and was ok. The dog just wrenched his jaw."

Should I wash my gym gloves?,"Yes, please do."
,yes if you want to.
,"Ha! I never washed my Gym gloves, and this question always comes to my mind..... I guess I need to wash them :)"
Do you use weightlifting gloves?,"I don't, but the bars can be very hard on the hands.
If you have soft hands and want to maintain their softness, I do recommend using weight gloves. Some do not like the callouses.
I do use wrist straps when lifting heavy weights. I find my grip is severely depleted after several sets/reps with heavy weights and the wrist straps alleviates this for me."

Is it Time For Me To Lose Weight? I'm 25 Years Old and 5'6 230lbs https://imgur.com/qyV9IOQ I don't thinks its really that bad.,"This is what i have discovered in my weight loss journey. No one can tell you when its time, you have to decide for yourself what you are going to do. Even what the doctors told me about my own well being  didn't make me want to lose weight. I decided when i was no longer happy with myself. I had begun to have low self-esteem and none of my clothes fit. I have to make my weight loss to God in prayer. I had to really meditate on my eating habits. I wanted to change for myself. When you are ready, you will do the same"

difference between cordless and wired mouse?,"Cordless and Wireless are the same. But corded/connected mouses should work better, because it's a direct connection between the PC and mouse. Wireless mouses need their own battery and sometimes the wireless connections get messed up (depending on interference). If you want the best mouse, look at Logitech's Gaming Laser Mouse (or something to that effect). It uses laser to track the movements and is much more accurate over bumpy surfaces than your standard ball or optical mouse."
,"Hello! A cordless mouse works with a Bluetooth key rather than a USB cable or any other sort of wiring. You will simply be required to plug the bud into one of the USB ports of your device and you can then use the mouse without having to worry about getting tangled. On the other hand, the wired mouse will have a power cord attached and this will always have to be plugged into the computer for use."
,I'm guessing that one has a cord and the other doesn't need one.
,"in my opinion , Cordless mouse need external power such as battery, while the Wired one can get power directly from your computer.

How to promotion a SEO website?,"SEO keywords are the ideas and topics that makes it possible for the users to find you via a search engine. In another term, it's a phrase or idea that make your content relevant and define the content of your web page. It is very important to every aspect of your SEO campaign. From Metadata description to content quality, keywords are used in everything because they are the primary source which boosts your ranking as well as online visibility. And the keyword research is the process of finding the right keywords for your post and the keyword volume tells roughly how many people are using this keyword for searching.

,"Tampa SEO – Google recently announced on January 17, 2018 that they will be prioritizing mobile page speed ranking factor over the next several months. Google confirms they are launching an update in July 2018. It will mainly effect slow loading mobile websites. Some slow loading results may still show up high in mobile search provided they contain the most relevant content, however, expect to see more prominent rankings for fast loading AMP sites (Accelerated Mobile Pages). Google Map Optimization Tampa
If you are unsure whether your site is prepared for the mobile Google PageSpeed insights, GTMetrix.comand get a free SEO audit on our website. If you find your site needs improvement and your not sure where to begin, please contact us for a free consultation.
Our Tampa SEO Rank Index measures SERP fluctuations for over 5000+ domains and keywords that our system monitors daily. It is one of the tools you can find under your ranking portal in our Google algorithm monitoring service.
We are now also logging SERP structure changes and track Google SERP features to determine whether ranking fluctuations are potentially being caused by changes in the type or number of vertical search engine results (e.g., Images, videos, News, Maps, etc.) that Google includes in their first page results.
On March 3rd, our SEO rank index discovered increased rank fluctuations on both desktop and mobile search results. While the uptick in rank fluctuations was initially moderate, the index caught an unusual and highly significant upsurge on March 9th. According to the index, fluctuations reached a level of 99 (out of 100) on desktop and 92 (out of 100) on mobile. After monitoring this over the last several days  the fluctuations have seemed to tapper off.
Also note, on March 12th, Search Engine Land reported that Google, uncharacteristically, confirmed the update as being related to its core algorithm (thereby explaining the unusually high fluctuations levels of March the 9th).

,"It’s not easy promoting a website, and many beginners will find that it’s a challenging and head-scratching process. The easiest and most popular way to promote your website and increase traffic to it is by using a method called Search Engine Optimisation (SEO). This post provides some simple SEO tips for beginners to help them promote their website.
Without going into technical details (this is for beginners, after all!), search engines are configured in such a way that every website must follow certain standards and updates for the common good of the customers (visitors). SEO is hard – if it was easy then all websites would be optimized amazingly! Hence we felt the need to share some simple SEO tips for beginners as it can all get a bit confusing.
By using SEO, you’ll find that it’s much easier to build an online presence for your website. This is done by boosting its “search equity”. The main objective of Search Engine Optimisation is, quite simply, to be found more easily by your target audience via the likes of Google and Bing. As such, search engines are recommending optimized websites for relevant searches conducted by using keywords.
1. Start building quality back-links
A straight-forward, yet well-known, method to help optimize your website is to build quality backlinks to obtain better SEO results. Before building backlinks, it’s important to check out how each backlink will react to your website and which ones are the best for you. You can check out more information about this topic on the awesome Moz. This simple SEO tip can be tricky to get going – we offer this service for high-ranking sites, as well as nice industry sector sites.
2. Social Media Marketing
Another effective SEO technique that you can apply to your website is social media marketing. Thanks to the advancements in technology and social media, many people use social media networks to look for information, research products before they buy them, share their experiences, etc.. By extending the keyword strategy to other social channels including Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Pinterest, alongside other digital marketing, content marketing or E-mail marketing campaigns, you can be sure that your site will receive significantly increased traffic than without social media activities. This is one of the really obvious and must-do simple SEO tips!
3. Use unique brand images
By integrating good images, you will make your website much more visually engaging while also helping to get backlinks. Instead of using Flash, include unique branded images (which can be done quickly and easily now thanks to the various online tools we can use for free) so that if anyone uses your images on their site, they will have your logo and URL on them.
4. Keep an eye your competitors
Before implementing any SEO technique, you should take some time to analyze the existing traffic on your site. It would also make sense to check out your competitors.
5. Content must be unique
It’s said that “content is King” – Content Marketing helps attract more visitors and prospects to your site, so the best thing to do is to create original content (read our eBook series, Content Marketing Matters, for some great tips and insights). Make sure your content is related to your website, relevant to your target audience, and provides added value for your visitors. It is also important to consider keywords research and focus on long-tail keywords so that search engines will index your site.
6. Branding is important
Many users often stay mesmerized by an industry name or brand. Even the name itself, tagline or the logo can make a big difference. If you want to keep more people on your website, choose a name or tagline that will define your business and website – be distinctive and try to include a strong keyword in your strapline. You’ll be surprised at what can help boost your traffic and brand awareness – perhaps one of the less obvious simple SEO tips!
7. Measure your website traffic
If you want your website to be SEO friendly, you’ll need Google Analytics. Google Analytics helps your website track and monitor the number of visitors drawn to your site and their activities once there. Aside from increasing traffic by helping you better understand it, adding Google Analytics will improve the conversion rates and help you identify which pages are popular and which aren’t, so you can take steps to improve.
By implementing various SEO techniques, you’re making sure that your website is easy to understand for both the search engine algorithms and your visitors. It will also help the search engine identify your web page so that you can attract more organic traffic too."
,It doesn't matter in which kind of services your business deals. An SEO website too can be promoted over various social media platforms. The thing requires only to is buying more Instagram followers to attract genuine followers over the site. You can look for other reliable ideas over the Instagram.
,"Hello!!
What is SEO?
The abbreviation of SEO is Search Engine Optimization. SEO is one challenge that most of the companies face. If your content is Search Engine Optimized, then it will help in ranking your website on one of the top organic results.
Generally, most users click on the first 3–5 results on Page 1 in case of searching for anything in Google or Yahoo. The tendency to move to the next few pages is very minimum, therefore a brand should consistently keep optimizing their site on a regular basis to reflect on top organic results.
How do we do it?
SEO might sound a little difficult to crack. But it is not as hard as it seems like.
Before writing the website content or any content, based on the topic, filter the keywords that a user can use while searching. With the help of Keyword Planner by Google, put down your product and get the top results of keywords. Try to use them in your content.
Also, while your website or webpage is being HTMLised, make sure you give your page, a unique URL with a specific keyword, give your webpage a page title, meta tag, meta description.
Google reads these codes and the keywords that are linked on your page will marry the content a user searches for if both tally then you win!! You will see your webpage on the organic results.
Make sure there are no broken links. All the links attached should render fine on desktop and mobile.
Also, add Alt tag and Alt description to the images linked on your web pages.
Using long tail keywords help more in SEO. You can use short tail keywords in the main content.
Your webpage should also be mobile responsive.
Connect your site to your social channels. If you want to rank your site in google quickly, then the first social site that you should give emphasis on is Google plus.

Google plus is the best social media for ranking your website in google. Create your business account in Google plus and then start producing and sharing content which will drive traffic to your websites.
Google+ will help SEO and it will also rank your page immediately. Ranking your page is important if you want more visitors to your site.

In order to get traffic to your website from your Google plus account, you need lots of followers. And to advertise and sell your products via Google you need a lot of good reviews.

If you have tons of followers then your followers will easily see your post and ratings about your products. To sell good product reviews is very important. Those who have lots of followers, they don’t need to spend extra money to get a number of reviews for some average products.

But those who are new on this platform, they face a lot of struggle to get their products reviewed. One of the easiest ways to solve this is to buy Google plus reviews.

One of the trusted sources to buy Google plus reviews is promoting team. They are a bunch of professionals who know how to deliver their services in the right way.
Once all these points are noted and checked, then slowly keep updating your keywords in the backend and constantly keep your page updated and social pages active for it to reflect organically. You are all set to promote your website organically with SEO."

How Do I Know My WASSCE Private Index Number?,"To find out you WASSCE private index number, you would have to contact either your school or the examinations authority itself. Alternatively, your index number should be displayed on relevant paperwork you have. In order to sit your examinations, you need to have your WASSCE private index number to hand. If you have lost a record of it for any reason, you shouldn't worry - an advisor at your school will be able to sort the issue out for you.

The WASSCE

The WASSCE - or West African Senior School Certificate Examination - is a standardized test sat by most secondary school students in Anglophone West African countries. It can not be sat by individuals in any other worldwide locations. Two different exams are available: One in December, one in June. The results of these exams are made available to schools and candidates a few months after them taking place.

A range of topics can be examined in the WASSCE. Some are compulsory to all candidates sitting the exam, such as science, mathematics and social studies. Others, such as woodwork, accounting and typewriting, are optional. Most candidates will sit the compulsory topics as well as around three extra additional areas of study. This gives students a broad range of knowledge upon leaving secondary education.

Controversy

The WASSCE system is not perfect. Students are regularly caught cheating, as are examiners, some of whom will be willing to accept bribes. There have been cases in which examiners have passed answers to students or admitted their papers under special circumstances. The marking of the WASSCE is in many cases very inaccurate and it is difficult for students to do anything about this. Overall, the WASSCE needs many improvements before it can gain an excellent reputation."

song just blew my mind the first time I heard it. I have been listening to the
single at least once a day ever since it was released."

difference between cordless and wired mouse?,"Cordless and Wireless are the same. But corded/connected mouses should work better, because it's a direct connection between the PC and mouse. Wireless mouses need their own battery and sometimes the wireless connections get messed up (depending on interference). If you want the best mouse, look at Logitech's Gaming Laser Mouse (or something to that effect). It uses laser to track the movements and is much more accurate over bumpy surfaces than your standard ball or optical mouse."
,"Hello! A cordless mouse works with a Bluetooth key rather than a USB cable or any other sort of wiring. You will simply be required to plug the bud into one of the USB ports of your device and you can then use the mouse without having to worry about getting tangled. On the other hand, the wired mouse will have a power cord attached and this will always have to be plugged into the computer for use."
,I'm guessing that one has a cord and the other doesn't need one.
,"in my opinion , Cordless mouse need external power such as battery, while the Wired one can get power directly from your computer.

How To Remove A Diamond From Its Setting?,"The diamonds are usually held in place in rings and earrings by little arms called prongs.

How you separate the precious stone from the setting depends on what material the prongs are made of.

In most cases, you (or a jeweler) should be able to bend the prongs open, using a pair of jeweler's tweezers, without too much hassle.

Removing your diamond from its setting
To pry a diamond out of its setting, you'll need to bend back the prongs that are holding it in place. This can usually be done using a tool known as jeweler's tweezers.

You can see examples of this implement (as well as other tools of the trade) at jewellertools.co.uk.

In certain cases, you may need to hit up the setting to make the prongs more malleable. Although the process should be fairly straightforward, I'd recommend taking your ring to a jeweler, as a professional will make sure no damage is done to the stone or the setting.

Some jewelers even offer the simple procedure free-of-charge, whilst others may charge a small fee.

Considering that you may have to invest in specialist equipment for removing the diamond yourself, it may be wiser to invest that money in the services of someone who knows what they're doing.

The following video might also be of interest to you:"
,Every Gold is very smooth metal as well as soft. So we have to easily pliers its small pairs & separate them each other.
,"Gold is a very soft metal, so a small pair of pointed pliers works well."
,"You will need specific tools to do the task, specially for prong settings, since it is the most delicate setting.

Jewelers have these tools and specialization in doing it."
What Are The Disadvantages Of An Electronics Data Processing?,"The disadvantages of electronic data processing or electronic document management systems are negligible compared to the advantages. One of the disadvantages is that this electronic data is vulnerable to attacks from cyber attacker and hackers and needs to be secured. Another issue can be that unless the data is properly backed up, the operations can seize if the system crashes."

Are There Any Real Lenders Who Will Loan Money If I Have Very Bad Credit And A Low Credit Score?,"Yes, there are lenders out there who will lend money to people who have bad credit and low credit score, but they do come with a very high interest rate.

You may end up paying back a lot more than you originally borrowed.

Getting a loan with a bad credit rating
Another drawback is that they are only short-term loans that have to be paid back perhaps quicker than you would like which could pose a problem to you.

It also depends what you need the money for and how much you want to borrow as the amount that you can borrow will vary from lender to lender so it is important that you find one that will lend you the amount you want.

There are Bad Credit Personal Loans available that can be secured or unsecured. A secured loan will need some form of collateral up front against the amount you want to borrow as a kind of insurance but it will have a low interest rate.

With an unsecured loan you will have no need to put anything up as collateral but the interest rate of the loan will be considerably higher.

If you need the money to purchase a new car there are Bad Credit Car Loans available. Again these can be secured or unsecured but you do not need to put any collateral as the loan is taken out against the car. So should you miss any repayments you will be in danger of losing your car.

How can I get a loan with a low credit score?
Payday Loans are easy to find online but are only for short-term use and are to tide you over until your next payday should you find yourself short, for whatever reason. All you have to do is to prove that you are employed and have a regular income coming in every month and be at least 18 years of age or older.

If you only need a short-term loan there are lenders online who will lend you the money you need without a credit search being done.

If you are really desperate and as a last resort only there are private money lenders out there but should be avoided at all costs as they charge really high interest rates."
,"Prosper.com will... But you can't have a lower credit score than 520.

I have what is rated as D credit in the low 600's and I have seen a lot of High Risk loans there or no credit ones... I wouldn't ask for a big loan to begin with though.

I only asked for the lowest amount I needed and that was 1000 dollars, the repay is 36 dollars a month for 3 years at 18% since it was what my state could charge... Check it out! They are for real..."
,"You should get a bad credit loan. In that case even if you have a bad credit history or can not pay off, you can easily survive."
,Only scammers have been contacting me have not yet found not even one genuine loan lender yet in 5 years.
,Prosper.com has a credit requirement of 640.
,"There are a lot of lenders who lend you with bad credit, but their interest rates are pretty high."
,"Hard money lenders can lend money with bad credit also. They are not asking for credit score also. So, you can easily get loan from them without credit score also. You also can obtain loan with unverified income information."
,There are definitely companies that will give you a loan with a bad credit score. They tend to have high interest rates though and they are set up to be used for emergencies. Make sure that you have a solid payment plan before you go for any of these loans. I hope this helps!
,Even If you have bad credit history then you can apply for payday loan with no credit check and you will receive the loan without any credit check easily.

What Are The Advantages And Disadvantages Of Computer Data Processing Over Manual Data Processing?,"Advantages
· Faster and efficient in processing of information;
· Automatic generation of accounting documents like invoices, cheques and statement of account;
·With the larger reductions in the cost of hardware and software and availability of user-friendly accounting software package, it is relatively cheaper like maintaining a manual accounting system;
· More timely information can be produced;
· No more manual processing of the data- all automatically been posted to the various ledgers/accounts and
· Many types of useful reports can be generated for management to make decisions

The main advantages of computerizing the activities of business organization are as follows:
Advantages:

Speed: Computerisation helps in processing the data placed in several data files in no time. This is possible due to the high speed of computers for processing data and CPU of the computer works at the speed of electricity which is the highest ever attainable speed.
Accuracy: The data processed by the computer are highly accurate. The programs written on the system checks and controls data before and during processing. It detects invalid data and ensures high degree of accuracy and reliability of output reports.
Flexibility: The modern digital computers can be used for a variety of purposes. E.g. Online processing, multiprogramming etc.
Choice of Configuration: Wide ranges of peripherals are available for many computer systems, which allow business organization to select those which most suit its processing requirements.
Storage capacity: Large volumes of data can be conveniently stored, accessed and altered.
Management information: They can be used to provide useful information of management for control and decision making.
Data Processing: Computer has lifted the heavy data processing constraint with the manual system and has opened up new avenues for planning, control and data experimentation.
Volume: Computers can store volumes of data and can retrieve the desired information quickly. This is very useful in the areas like insurance, bank accounts etc where large number of documents is handled every day.
Database: Computer facilities the establishment of database. Such a database integrates data records and reduces data redundancy.
Reduction in paper work: The use of computers for data processing has helped the management of business organizations to cope with increasing problem of paper handling. The computers have speeded up the process and have eliminated the paper needs through the storage of data in elaborately constructed data bases and files.
Reduced cost: Though the initial investment for installing a computer is high, but it substantially reduces the cost of each of its transaction. Cost reduction occurs due to processing of huge data and record keeping.
Facilitates report preparation: Computer facilitates the preparation of various types of reports required by organizational executives for the purpose of decision making and control.
Reduce the space requirements: The use of computer for office activities reduces the requirements of office space which otherwise is required.
Reduces the manpower requirement: The number of persons required for performing various organizational activities will be reduced by using a computer system.
Increased ability to perform computations: Computers perform computations with a very high speed.
Diligence: Being a machine, it does not suffer from boredom, tiredness or lack of concentration, even if millions of computations are to be performed by a computer. It performs the calculations with same accuracy and speed.

Disadvantages:

· Power failure, computer viruses and hackers are the inherent problems of using computerized systems;
·Once data been input into the system, automatically the output are obtained hence the data being input needs to be validated for accuracy and completeness, we should not forget concept of GIGO (Garbage In(Input) Garbage out ( Output) and
· Accounting system not properly set up to meet the requirement of the business due to badly programmed or inappropriate software or hardware or personnel problems can caused more havoc and
· Danger of computer fraud if proper level of control and security whether internal and external are not properly been instituted."
What Are The Advantages Of File Based System?,"A typical file-based system or filesystem is an excellent way of categorizing and storing different types of information; a filesystem will store files according to text names that are readable by human beings...not just a computer processor. In a file-based system, there will be options to alter and retrieve data at any time, through the use of computer commands. Every individual file will have it own name and will be called a computer file. Data files, or computer files, will then be placed on an organized system that begins at the top, with a master group of files, and tapers downward to single files. In this way, every file belongs somewhere, and each file can be accessed as part of a larger group.

This efficient system of data organization is created through the use of hardcode programs that latch onto needed information stored in a specific region. While virtual ""folders"" filled with individual document files are used, data can also be saved in a single-file format (also called a flat-file system). A file-based system is a great way to find documents on a daily basis, and a beneficial method of preserving a collection of important information from myriad sources, departments, and authors.

A file-based computer system can be used with a variety of computer hardware and accessories, including:

• CD-ROMs
• USB sticks
• External Hard Drives
• Main Hard Disks

Adding insertions, deletions, and updates to files is simple and organized when a file-based system is employed. Often, there will be little need for full-time IT staff to monitor and safeguard the database; updates and checks can be performed as needed. However, a certain amount of security concerns may exist with these file-based systems, as they have a tendency to be more prone to being hacked or corrupted."

,"Weight can be maintained, decreased or increased by  calculating daily calorie requirements according to your daily activities like sedentary, moderately active, active and very active. To calculate daily calorie requirements, first of basal metabolic rate (BMR) is calculated by following formula and then follow strictly these calories intake.
BMR for Men=66+(13.7 X wt in kg)+(5 X ht in cm)-(6.8X age in years)
BMR for women =655+(9.6 X wt in kg)+(1.8 X ht in cm)-(4.7 X age in years).
Now multiply your BMR with activity multiplier.
Sedentary = BMR X 1.2
Lightly active = BMR X 1.375
Moderate Active = BMR X 1.55
Very active = BMR X 1.725
Extraordinary active = BMR X 1.9.
In this way you can calculate your daily calories requirements. If you want to reduce or increase weight then put your desired weight in the weight space of the BMR formula."
,"How To Lose Fat – The Basic Principles Of Fat Loss
Many people want to know how to lose fat, which could be
for a number of reasons such as: To become fitter, healthier, back in good
shape or look more attractive.
Also, fat loss is very important for people who want to get a muscular or
toned body. It’s important to get rid of excess fat when building muscle so
that you can have a good level of leanness and  muscle definition that
will result in an impressive  physique.
If your body has a lot more
fat than it should, then this is caused by a combination of your genetics,
eating habits and lifestyle that provides the way for your body to
consistently store excess fat.
However, if you want to get rid of fat to get your body to become leaner,
then this can be done by learning the basic principles of fat loss and using a
good fat burning diet and exercise program that will work for you.
Just likegaining muscle mass, losing fat takes time and discipline.
You must be consistently following a good fat loss program that is designed
properly to fit your personal circumstances to reach success.
Below I outline the basic principles of how to lose fat that all fat
loss/weight loss plans and programs have to address.
How Excess Fat Is Stored In The Body
Although losing fat is the focus of this article it’s important to first
have an understanding of how you get fat on your body in the first place. This
is necessary if you seriously want to get lean and stay lean.
Without elaborating, you get fat anytime you consume more calories than your
body burns in a day. Calories are contained in different quantities in all
types of foods that we eat and drink, and they provide energy for your
body to do everything.
For example, a small size bar of Chocolate contains a lot more calories
than a big Apple. Therefore, eating lots of chocolate will result in a large
amount of calories accumulating in your body quickly. Any time your total daily
calorie intake is more than your total daily energy expenditure, you’ll gain
weight.
    “Some foods contain a lot more calories than
others. Therefore, they’ll make you fat faster“
Whenever you eat lots of calories and do not use them all up (burn energy),
mainly because you did not do enough physical activity, the extra calories will
be stored as fat.
Consuming more calories than the amount your body needs to maintain it’s
weight is also known as a calorie surplus. A calorie surplus normally leads to
weight gain because if the body is not using up calories, it’ll store them. And
unless you do proper resistance training to build muscle with the extra
calories, they will be stored as fat.
To put it in a simple equation:
More calories In, less calories out = weight gain
More calories out, less calories in = weight loss
Resistance exercise plus weight gain = muscle mass gain (with possibly
some fat)
Weight gain with no resistance exercise = Mostly fat stored
So the above shows that calories consumed in excess results in weight gain
because the extra calories are not used up by the body to supply for energy
demands. And it also shows that the only way weight gain would not be mostly
fat stored is when resistance training is applied to build muscle mass with the
extra calories.
How To Lose Fat Is To Make Use Of The Right Diet And Exercise Plan
To Achieve A Caloric Deficit
A caloric deficit is a must to lose fat stored in the body. A caloric
deficit simply means consuming less calories than the amount your body burns,
and this actually is the most important factor for losing body fat. The longer
your body remains in a healthy calorie deficit, the more fat you’ll burn.
How To Create A Caloric Deficit?
You create a calorie deficit by consuming less calories in your diet and/or
exercising more to burn additional calories so that you are consuming less
calories than you expend. You first have to calculate your calorie maintenance level or total daily energy expenditure
to be able to create a deficit.
When your body is not getting enough calories from your food intake to use
for energy demands, it’ll start burning the fats that’s stored in your body.
That’s the reason a calorie deficit is crucial to achieve fat loss.
Although the calorie deficit is the paramount factor for fat loss, there are
a lot more elements that are also very important.
Some people, after learning that a calorie deficit is what they need to lose
body fat, may decide to simply cut lots of calories from their diet by removing
almost all foods that are high in calories and start exercising aggressively
for hours everyday.
This may sound like the right thing to do for losing fat fast, but it’s not
the correct approach to take for long term, sustainable fat loss and success in
getting lean.
You Must Have A Good Healthy Plan To
Lose Fat Correctly
The right thing to do when you want to start losing body fat is to take time
to figure out which fat loss plan is right for you by taking into consideration
other factors such as maintaining good health, maintaining muscle mass, your
body type, your ability to stick to the plan etc.
Working along with a well structured, safe, suitable and effective plan to
lose fat will greatly increase your chances of successfully reducing the amount
of body fat that you want to get rid of, because it’ll make your efforts more
likely to produce positive results without negative side effects.
All fat loss programs must be structured properly to allow the users to
create a calorie deficit to burn stored fat, but there are different ways of
creating the deficit. A combination of proper nutrition and exercise is the
best way to lose fat and get additional benefits.
Everyone’s circumstances and goals are different and would need to use the
right fat loss plan that’ll work best for them. A fat loss plan can be as
simple as eating less food and walking more everyday or as complex as tracking
every nutrition component in your diet and performing strategic cardio and
weight lifting workouts.
Of course, the type of plan that you use will impact the results that you
get. But don’t think about results alone when considering which approach to
use. Try to be objective by looking at everything that will affect you such as
your personal preferences, body type, lifestyle, schedules etc.
So on a final note, losing fat is accomplished by a calorie deficit and
anyone can do it, but you must use the right diet and exercise program that
meet your individual needs best to reach success."

,"You're making more difficult than it needs to be.

All diets, regardless if they are counting points(weight watchers), food exchanges, calories, or have you eating certain foods which inhibit you from eating more calories(calories are a unit of measurement for energy) work on the same principle. Get the body to burn more calories than it takes in via manipulation of energy balance.
What is energy balance? It's a term used to describe the balance of energy(again measured in calories in the U.S. Or Joules in Asia/Europe) with either it being negative or positive.
When it's positive, you are in a energy surplus(excess calories) than your body requires to function and the excess is ""stored"" in body fat.

,"1. Eating the right food
2. Sleep 6-8 hours
3. Avoid Stress
4. Mild Exercise"
,"Weight Maintenance:

You will maintain your current weight by keeping your daily caloric intake at or around your maintenance level.
Maintenance calories = bodyweight x 15. (ex: 130 poundsx15 = 1,950 calories/day).
Fat Loss:

You lose fat by maintaining a caloric deficit over time.  Try eating 500 calories less than your maintenance each day(in this example, that would be 1,450)...that will create a 3,500 calorie/week deficit which is the amount of calories you need to burn to lose 1 pound.
Note: When in a deficit, you can't control how much of the weight loss is fat, how much is muscle loss or how much is simply water weight loss...

When you first start a diet you will see a lot of water weight loss in the first week....

To avoid muscle loss, do resistance training and don't maintain too large a caloric deficit (500 calories below is a safe deficit)...remember, cardio can further reduce your deficit past 500 calories/day...this is fine if you have more weight on you to lose though.
Lean Weight Gain:

Adding lean mass to your frame comes from breaking down your muscle tissues by lifting heavy weights and eating in a caloric surplus to provide the nutrients to build the muscle.
Again, to minimize the fat gain when in a surplus of calories, don't eat more than 500 calories OVER your maintenance daily...Eating 200-300 calories over maintenance will ensure most of the weight is lean mass.
Make sure you're getting at least your bodyweight in grams of protein.  So if you weigh 130 pounds, get at least 130g of protein...

Protein is necessary to build lean tissue.
Also, make sure you are lifting a weight that is heavy (you can just barely lift about 8x on the first set), if you don't lift heavy, those extra calories are more likely to go to fat storage than repairing/building muscle tissue.
You can find more info on the proper way to go about any of these goals here."

Hi.i have a reebok treadmill and the oil light has just lit up.i dont have instructions any idea were oil goes as doesnt seem to be a reservior anywhere?,"You probably have to lubricate the surface of the shafts that spin the running surface.  I think that if you look around at treadmill maintenance posts, you will find some people referencing spraying silicone onto these.  That is the only appl;ication of any oil/lube that I could think of anyway in this case."
Its national trivia day. And its national spaghetti day. So who likes spaghetti????????????????????????,WooHoo! I like both!
,I'll take alittle of both.
,I like both.
,I love spaghetti and trivia! This is my kind of day!
,"I like both. So here you go....
The name for which kind of pasta also means ""little worms""?
Answer:    Vermicelli"
,"I like to bake my spaghetti! Lol!
Trivia... I'll watch you smartie's play! ?? To me it's more like a test then a game! ??"
,It's a good day!  Nothing like sharing trivia with good friends over a delicious dish of spaghetti!  I'm in.
,"Hi Otis! I definitely love spaghetti! I will normally buy freshly made portions from my local Italian restaurant and I will have it with minced chicken or lamb. When it comes to trivia, I will have to admit that I am not a big fan! I do enjoy puzzles though, but these are pretty different!"
What foods promote a healthy lifestyle?,"You know, I'm not much into healthy lifestyle science. But from what I'm experiencing - avoid stale foods, try to eat fresh and organic if possible. Also, avoid fried foods with oil. Oil oxidizes under high temperatures and that's pretty lethal in the long run. When frying (because fried foods are often very tasty), try to use legitimate butter. It doesn't do that chemical reaction and is great in taste, too. Yeah, a bit more expensive, but meh."
,"Fresh vegetables, fish, low calorie foods, fresh fruits"
,"Fish, vegetables are good for the health, if we can eat them every day, but some meat as beef and chicken  are healthy too,although not eating them too much."
,"The food which contains protein, Nutrients promote your healthy life style.Include following food in your diet plan:
-Milk
-Fruits
Green Vegetables
Fish
Egg
Fruit juices
Vegetable soup"
,See this blog post for healthy eating
,"Hi Leanne! I suppose that you can start with organically grown vegetables. These are produced in very ethical ways and they will hence taste better. However, they are often pricier than normal crops. You will also have to try to include some exercise to your routine and remember that consistency is key!"
,Any food eating in moderation coupled with exercise.
,I like celery with peanut butter and grapes are also good to.
,a lot of vegetables and nuts
,Go with hygienic food at top vegetarian restaurants in Nagpur.
can I eat seaweed everyday?,"If you can stomach seaweeds everyday! I read that seaweeds are richer in minerals than almost any other food. It is calculated that from 7 to 38 percent of the seaweed’s dry weight is made up of “the minerals required by human beings, including calcium, sodium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, iodine, iron, and zinc.”"
,Sure. That is good for you
,"Listen to your body. If you like it and you feel the need to eat it every day, you can do that. Maybe, there's a lack of some vitamins in your organism, that is why you eat it every day."

My nephew married a former personal trainer. I may take her up on her offer to make up a workout plan for me.

,"Hey,
I think it is mostly youngsters who seek to study overseas. This could be
because they are adventurous and eager to explore a new country and new culture
and meet people from every corner of the world. Or maybe, it is because of
greater career prospects abroad. I hope the answer was relevant. Have a nice
day."

Do you know any people that put celebrities and all the worldly things before God?,"I know of many people who don’t believe in any gods, so by default, they put everything else in front of what they don’t believe."
,"Sure, but lets be specific . . Which God are you referring to?
I also know people who put all worldly things before Santa, The Easter Bunny, and ""Zorg"" the magical Space Pixie . . .
The ""Worldly things"" you refer to are tangible objects we can interact with . . . Like cell phones, Televisions, Cars . . . They require no ""Faith"" to interact or believe in.
To me, it seems much more odd to believe in unverifiable magic claims, then it does to have actual KNOWLEDGE about the material things we interact with  . . . Daily."
,"Yes, God isn't as popular as he use to be. Even more so, they seek to be famous themselves through facebook, twitter etc as Aleister Crowley said ""Everyone's A Star."" 
Vanity, devils favourite sin :)
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=G3jaPBFXFTU"
,"Q ""Do you know any people that put celebrities and all the worldly things before God?""
It is people who make the celebrities and then they idolise them, will nearly do anything for them or to be like them and even almost worship them. They wouldn't be celebrities if people didn't turn them into celebrities in the first place. People can be strange."
,"I do. They are from the vain world. Glamour is the ultimate at any cost. 
Further, Glamour is there God and the God demands are of drinks, drugs and sex to attain oneness with God."
It is 2 Jan 2018. The New Year is already over 24 hours old. Do you expect any major changes in 2018?,"No major changes, just more of the things I already enjoy. Waiting on my computer to be returned so I can start planning more camping trips."
,Great things for sure! I am very hopeful at quite a few things going on this year! ????????????????
,Yes!  This is my final day of employment.  :)
,no not really.
,If I had that ability to predict? I would be a rich man.
,My granddaughter graduates from VMI in May.  That's the only big thing happening.
,No. My life a been the same mostly unhappiness for the last 20 yrs... I hope this will be my last year on earth. Old Girl is tired of trying everything ??
How do you change your attitude into something positive? Does being positive makes life easier?,"You make a conscious decision to change it. As for making life easier? You will have to still face all of life's challenges, they just won't drag you down, and can make finding solutions easier.
I have a friend who was always complaining about life. A year ago someone gave her a book about gratitude and positive thinking. One of her biggest complaints was her job. Once she started looking at the positives, she realized it wasn't her job she hated. She actually loved what she did. It was her employer that was the problem. She starting looking around for another place to work. She found one. Not only is the boss better, but the co-workers are happier making for a much better work environment. AND she now makes more money and has better hours.
Focusing on what is good about your life makes it easier to fix what is wrong.
She started her change by starting her day listing 3-5 things was thankful for. She posted them on Facebook. Some friends liked it others complained. Those that complained are not getting much attention nowadays. Those that supported her are. Surrounding yourself with positive people helps. I really enjoyed her positive posts because it made me think about what I am grateful for. "
,"I can tell you to ""Always look on the Bright side of Life"" until I am blue in the face.
How you personally look at the world is not just as simple as you choosing to view the Glass as half full all the time. It takes years of exposure to life with all of its experiences to get you to the world view you currently have right now . . . The idea of simply waking up with a contradictory view one day is just not going to happen. Even with medications bringing up your dopamine and serotonin levels . . . It takes time. . . . A very long time with small changes to even get close.
Start with little goals that you can easily attain and work towards mid-term goals  . . . Then maybe long term goals.

im crying right now? i lost this group of close friends even though i apologize countless of times but they feel very awkward? i really don't feel the point of living? please be kind. i been crying for hours,"well first of all...stop crying...
secondly....as you said that u apologized countless of times then theres no need to feel sad. They DONT DESERVE YOU. Even tho thye might be better looking  , popular, A-graders , whatever....you dont need them.
when life hits you with such things, learn that everything happens for a reason and who knows, your good lies in staying away from them?
so i know its hard,,but easy to say , but this is the most i can say right now.
now here comes two choices..
1.Do you want to stay in depression and sadness just cos of a couple of ""people"" who dont want to be your ""close"" friend anymore?
2.Or do you want to calm down, get life sorted, your priorities sorted, shake it off and move on and go on to find better people ?
so there you go, its totally on you...now cheer up and make the right choice! :)"

What Does An Electrical Engineer Do? What Are The Basic Strengths And Weaknesses Of An Electrical Engineer?,"As a licensed electrician, I have noticed a few weaknesses of electrical engineers (EEs). EE's are not required to attend update classes, or any other training to keep up with code changes and equipment updates.
EE's design home, commercial and secondary distribution systems, but they do not pull permits, which a licensed electrician does.
By Michigan Law, a licensed electrician is the only one who pulls permits, installs electrical devices and can accept the work. EE's that are not up to date pull shortcuts, and do not follow the electrical codes, which make the electrician's life difficult and make jobs cost more."
,"EE's are very BOOK focused, and if it's new or not in his books it's wrong!
They tend to be very bigoted and unable to walk on new or virgin ground! Are so book smart that they forget the sun was once TAUGHT it went around the earth, and 98% are this way, too!

However this is not the only group with this ""God Like"" attitude for it is common all Phd's and others, too.

This is the very reason ""The Durants"" came up with that question about the tree I posted. For the farther down the tree you see the better you would would be in research, where the books help but do not rule.

The best I've seen on that question (other than my partner and I) saw the trunk of the tree!

For a true analytical mind or one with a very high degree of logic and reasoning is very uncommon and most say it's very rare.

Answer that question honestly and be honest, or your cheating yourself only.
However that was given to me by Charles Durant, and even though I'm not positive, I believe that question originally came from his grandfather ""The World Renowned"" and ""Award Winning"" ""Will Durant"" He died in 1882!

Also check out the difference between Apple and IBM, for that was logic and reasoning in it's purest form!"

What Are The Advantages And Disadvantages Of A Private Education?,"A private education can have many advantages.
Private education offers the chance for a child to grow in terms of personal development and confidence.
Many private schools are highly academic and are ideal for a motivated, academic student. However many private schools are less academically focused and aim to provide a good all round education for children on a variety of levels rather than being purely academic.
State schools are not always in good catchment areas and private education can ensure that the majority of the classes are full of motivated pupils in many cases.
Personal development is highly valued and children get more individual attention in the private sector.
The downside is that students at private schools do not mix with a wide mixture of other children from different backgrounds and may have a narrower perspective on a range of social issues. Conversely some may argue that this is a positive in favour of the private sector.
One disadvantage which is a major one is cost. Many parents and children are at a disadvantage because of the cost of fees which are usually very high - the present Labour Government withdrew assisted place funding which benefited many gifted children.
There are some scholarships and bursaries available but the competition for them is high."
,Advantages And Disadvantages Of A Private Education
,Disadvantages of private schools in Nigeria
,"Positives:
Small class sizes.
Impressive test scores (not always, though).
A wider variety of extra-curricular on-site opportunities (not always)
A smaller tightly knit school community.
Not necessarily tied to the National Curriculum (some independent schools follow it, anyway).
Not required to sit SATs.

Negatives:
High cost (for most a consideration!).

""Keeping up with the Jones'"": if your child's classmates are wealthy and manifest that wealth, will your child feel left out if your family doesn't have as much money?

Many private schools do not require their teachers to have the same level of achievement or accreditation as is required in the state sector.

Cultural or social isolation: your child will probably a larger range of other types of people in a state school.

Being tapped for money: if you thought the state sector schools are always fund-raising, that's not a patch on the work that private schools have to do to get extra money in.

Can be bad or good
Hot-housing: not an issue everywhere, but do you want your child in an environment with high academic expectations? What if that's not what they're like?

Formality (independents are usually more formally run)."

,"If your aim is to improve your aptitude and knowledge base in a particular field, all education pertaining to this subject will useful. If this statement is assumed true, then the benefits afforded by private tuition are enormous. You will have the advantage of a whole teacher to yourself, with their lesson plans and strategies of teaching designed just for you! It seems impossible to doubt the enormous benefits this will offer. In a classroom, one teacher may be faced with around thirty pupils, each with different abilities, different rates of learning, and individual strengths and weaknesses; yet despite this, for the majority of the lesson the teacher will be forced to treat his class as if it contained just one student. He or she will orate from one end of the classroom, unable to gauge how effectively each pupil is assimilating the lesson. The lesson plans will be designed to fit the needs of the average pupil; and the teacher will proceed at a rate suitable for the average pupil.
In this environment it is all to easy for a bright child or adolescent to fail to grasp one particular point, as the swathe of teacher talk washes over them like the unrelenting tides. It is unlikely even the best of teachers would spot the particular point of misunderstanding cast on the countenance on one pupil, hidden amongst so many other faces. To draw attention to their lack of understanding can be intimidating for the pupil: Everyone else is silent, so they must have understood. Do I want to draw attention to myself? All too often the misunderstanding goes unexpressed and unaided. The obvious benefit of one to one tuition is that the tutor can tailor their teaching style to the abilities of their student. They will be able to gauge the level of the pupils understanding, and, more importantly, track down the sources of misunderstanding, and deal with them effectively. Away from the bustle of the classroom, the student will feel more able to voice their difficulties; and having just one pupil to deal with, the teacher will be more capable of resolving them.
Compared to the conflicts of the classroom, fraught with distractions and intimidations from other pupils, the relaxed environment of tutor and student can be a safe haven of erudition. Most tutors will be willing to travel to the pupil's house, allowing them the benefit of learning in a happy home location.A tutor will be able to focus their teaching on a particular area: The pupil may be very competent in mathematics overall, but be deficient in calculus, with this specific weakness undermining their whole confidence in the subject. Maybe they are highly literate and proficient in English language, but shy away from public speaking. The syllabus may demand some oral work (foreign languages certainly do), so it would be a shame if this particular and minor deficiency detracted from their overall grade in the subject. Even if the pupil is performing well at school or college, it is highly likely that some private tuition will give then the edge over their peers. For it is their friends and contemporaries that they are competing against - many of whomay already be receiving tuition. In an age where extra tuition is almost becoming the norm, it may be necessary to join in, or risk being left behind. "

difference between cordless and wired mouse?,"Cordless and Wireless are the same. But corded/connected mouses should work better, because it's a direct connection between the PC and mouse. Wireless mouses need their own battery and sometimes the wireless connections get messed up (depending on interference). If you want the best mouse, look at Logitech's Gaming Laser Mouse (or something to that effect). It uses laser to track the movements and is much more accurate over bumpy surfaces than your standard ball or optical mouse."
,"Hello! A cordless mouse works with a Bluetooth key rather than a USB cable or any other sort of wiring. You will simply be required to plug the bud into one of the USB ports of your device and you can then use the mouse without having to worry about getting tangled. On the other hand, the wired mouse will have a power cord attached and this will always have to be plugged into the computer for use."

What Is Source Data Automation? Example Of Source Data Automation,"Source Data Automation is the use of automated methods of data entry that attempt to reduce or eliminate many of the activities, people and data media required by traditional data entry methods. It is basically the process of collecting data at the point of origin in digital form.

Automated data entry eliminates much of the effort and delay in the extra handling involved in traditional data entry methods and therefore the potential for error in duplicated entries etc.. The data can then be collected straight from the Source Data Automation device, which is ready to process the transaction and it is possible to instantly check for accuracy during the data entry process.

Its many benefits have made source data automation a compelling choice for many types of commercial data entry today. Source data automation has transformed a number of information handling tasks. For example, workers who take orders over the phone today usually enter needed input directly into a display workstation, so they don't have to record the same data twice.

Source data automation also speeds up checkout lines and inventory taking at supermarkets, quality control operations in factories and check processing in banks. Examples of source data automation include bar code scanners, (otherwise known as Optical Character Readers), Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR codes) on bank checks, the magnetic stripe on credit cards, touch screens and voice recognition systems. Source Data Automation is used because of its cost effectiveness; it contains accurate and complete data and provides quick  availability of data. It is also easy to track operational trends and can support decisions."

always go out for a jog. I try my best to stay healthy. And if there is nothing
much to do at night, I would probably watch a movie or a documentary. That’s
it! Nothing interesting at all."
,"Successful people tend to spend their free time in these seven ways (and more, of course), so read below and find out why:
They Exercise. ...
They Read. ...
They Take Classes. ...
They Volunteer. ...
They Network. ...
They Have Hobbies. ...
They Spend Time With Friends and Family."
,Free time? Does somebody really have free time?
,Because of workload i usually get free time at night and that time i like to have dinner with my family and take a well sleep in my room and when i am totally free at my weekends then i like to go out with family and do some shopping and spend time with friends.
,I like to read and watching movies.
,"Whenever I have time for myself, I like to go out with my
family or friends. However, these days, I am barely free as I am working
overtime. Last month, my cousins and I went shopping for my father’s birthday party.
We had lunch outside and we had a lot of fun."
,"I watch hockey with my family. Big screen, cola, crisps, and emotions running high. Awesome. And I'm very unhappy if I miss any match. But fortunately, here https://777score.com/ I can find all the matches that I happened to miss."

"Boyfriend of 5 years. Stays over at my home every weekend, 3 days. Today, he didn't want to go home after 3 days, got angry.

What causes Anxiety and how to control it?,"Among the greatest of these is the loss of a love one in death. Also ranked high are personal injury or illness, loss of a job and financial reverses. The emotion of anger may be the worst for causing tension. Many individuals have fallen dead as a result of heart attacks brought on by fits of rage. Are you inclined to be quick-tempered? If so, it will help you to get a more balanced viewpoint, realizing that ‘blowing one’s top’ is not a sign of strength, but of weakness.
In short, what can you do about tension? If it springs from an attitude of mind, change the attitude. Seek a change of pace from your regular routine through periodic breaks, through physical activity or by pursuing a constructive hobby. If possible, avoid aggravating, stress-producing situations, and prepare yourself in advance for unexpected stress."

Why cancer need proper cure and treatment?,The Times states that early detection “means less pain and trauma for both the patient and his or her family. In addition it enables doctors to take timely measures.”
,Cancer eats from inside shows signs until it is too late. Early detection of what type and treatment would be ideal.
,"Cancer is the leading disease all over the world. All those medical science have made great progress in the biology of cancer cells, and they have already been able to improve the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. But instead of just waiting for a new discovery for cancer prevention, you can do a lot to protect yourself from this severe disease like adopting the healthy lifestyle, healthy diet, regular exercise and regular medical checkup if you have any family history for cancer."
What is your theory on the extinction of the dinosaurs?,"They were unable to survive the catastrophic aftermath of the Chicxulub meteor impact, 66 million years ago. There is also evidence the dinosaurs were already in general decline due to a dramatically variable climate pattern over a long period prior to Chicxulub. "
,Hi Joyce! I do believe in the fact that a meteorite ended things for these mighty lizards! The impact was so nasty and it caused the death of most life forms on our planet! Whatever survived had to quickly evolve to keep up with very harsh environmental conditions and live on very little food. This eventually caused their sizes to shrink and they became animals that we see today!
,"When the dinosaurs had fulfilled their purpose, God ended their life. But the Bible is silent on how he did that or when. I am sure that dinosaurs were created by Jehovah for a purpose, even if I do not fully understand that purpose."

Why do parents let kids watch horror movies that are rated R?,Perhaps the parents consider it safer to take them than leave them in the questionable care of a baby-sitter. Some of the children watch R- and X-rated movies either through the cable or on movies their parents keep at home.

can I eat seaweed everyday?,"If you can stomach seaweeds everyday! I read that seaweeds are richer in minerals than almost any other food. It is calculated that from 7 to 38 percent of the seaweed’s dry weight is made up of “the minerals required by human beings, including calcium, sodium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, iodine, iron, and zinc.”"

What Was Education Like 100 Years Ago?,"Actually a lot harder.  Imagine all the mathematics courses you have to take now, but without the convenience of a calculator.  You had to do it all long hand with an abacus and a slide rule.  You were actually expected to know and articulate the significance of specific historical events.  You not only did more writing, but you did it by hand with a pen and paper, and you were expected to actually conform to standard rules governing spelling, punctuation, grammar, etc, or you would fail... Oh and that is in Latin as well as English.  Being able to read, write, and speak foreign languages was one of the benchmarks of an educated individual.  As an example, Thomas Jefferson could fluently speak Latin, Greek, and French by the time he was 16, and was already in university studying Mathematics and philosophy.  He graduated with honors and was a bar certified lawyer by the time he was 24."

Its national buffet day .national science fiction day. And national personal traine awarness day.so do u like personnal trainners????????????????????????????????????,I haved never had a personal trainer. I have the option of getting one though. My nephew married a former personal trainer. I may take her up on her offer to make up a workout plan for me.
,I love a good buffet!  And I can't resist a good sci-fi story!  (Will keep the trainer on the back burner for now.)    :)
,"I love science fiction and I read it a lot :) I can't say that I've been to many buffets or that I've ever had a personal trainer, but I'll go with sci-fi."
,Wow. Personal fitness trainer day. They don't give you much time with your newly formed belly rolls after Christmas.
,"No buffets for me.... Too many germy hands on the handles of the food sneezing and talking little particles of spit in the food! NO THANK YOU! ???? Lol!
I want a personal trainer! I need to lose weight."
,"The Chinese buffet is one of our favorites. We like to go when we know they are busy, because they are constantly bringing out fresh food.              
  I like Sci-Fi."
,Just not my day!  Thank you Otis.
,"Hi Otis. I've never had a personal trainer, buffets are ok, and I'm not really into sci-fi's."
"I think I observed my friend slamming the door, more or less, at my home, when they didn't get their way in an argument. Do I address the issue or just let it go?","Unless something broke because of it, let it go."
,Let it go!
,Wait till your friend has calmed down. Confront him/her and tell him/her to stay away from yor house. Next time it could be worse.
,"You said you ""think""!
Let it go."
,"Either they slammed the door or they didn’t! Can’t have it both ways.  If they copped an attitude and slammed the door,  No one needs that kind of immaturely in their life.  When he/she calms down, politely ask them why they did that. If you get more attitude politely ask them to leave your life..  I never slammed a door by accident, I’ve opened a few that had no resistance and had them hit the wall lightly.  The only doors that I slammed was on the SWAT entry team and through the use of an 8 pound key, or had the need to blow the door open with a slight charge. But slamming one on leaving because of an attitude is in acceptable!"

If it is a 30 minute drive, he can take his butt home. If it is a 90 minutes, I say let him stay. If you just want some alone time, be honest and tell him so. If he can't understand or respect that, then it is time to find  new boyfriend."

What Are The Advantage And Disadvantage Of Public Education?,"The major advantages of public school education are as follows :-

1) Your child is exposed to the maximum number of people which helps them learn to get along with people from different background. This also leads to a greater synergy in terms of diversity as each group bring their own set of unique experiences.

2) Public schools generally follow a standardized curriculum and is calibrated ubiquitously through out the country

3) Public schools are free.

4) Public schools are generally secular in charter as they do not expose the children to religious studies.

The disadvantages of Public schools however are :-

1) There's generally more reported acts of violence in public schools.

2) Individual attention is very rare since they sport bigger classroom with greater number of pupils."

Why Do Women Love To Wear Jewellery?,"Women love to wear jewelry for a variety of reasons and many will not leave the house without having some jewelry on. Jewelry to many women is a form of statement. It expresses what they like and also can be a great visual indicator to a person's wealth.

Many woman will spend a considerable sum of money on jewelry as they believe it will show just how wealthy they are. However it is not always simple to define if the person's jewelry is really that expensive. Over the past few years more and more 'imitation' jewelery pieces have flooded the market from the Far East. If you look on auction sites such as eBay.com you can see there are rings, necklaces and earrings that look almost identical to ones that cost $5,000 but are actually on sale for around $10.

Women love to wear jewelry that is sentimental to them. It may be due to the piece of jewelry being bought by a loved one or they may have bought it from a special place such as on holiday and so it is a great memory of this particular time. Some woman also believe jewellery can have a very powerful spiritual meaning and so will wear particular necklaces that represent things such as luck or love.

Religion is also a major part of why some women wear jewelry. The crucifix is one of the most popular pieces of jewelry in the world and works as a clear way of declaring their religion."
,"Some people can wear jewellery as an accessory, as others where it as culture, religin or medical reasons. Not all people wear Jewellery as a statement."
,"Now-a-Days
jewelry has become a style statement. It enhances the looks of the wearer and
symbolizes love, delight and fashion sense."
,I love jewellery. Especially the gold type of jewellery. In fact I can't do without wearing them. They make me look more beautiful and like a real woman. I can spend any amount on my jewellery.
,"It's just in their nature... Just like men love to drink beer... To go fishing, play football etc. ;)"
,Because it makes them feel unique
,Old Question so that Amber Buddy can advertise.
,To sometimes feel sexier or feel important or to just look good
,"To express who they really are or to tell people ""this is me"""
,We all know that women want to look stylish and beautiful. Jewelry is something that augments the wearer's look tremendously. That's why women love jewelry.
,"Jewellery is of course a sign of one’s status. Wearing a piece of jewellery that looks expensive is definitely a way to show that one is wealthy. In these cases, the designs of the jewellery or the materials used are usually more important than making a fashion statement.
I wear jewellery because I love it very much. Some women also wear to impress or to show others. Last month I had bought some amber stones from ""Drfinejewels"" and use these for making a bracelet. Really this looks beautiful and attractive."
,"There are so vain, they would wear anything if they think it makes them look good."
,"Everywhere in the world, women are wearing an ample variety of jewelry. Whether it is about necklaces, bracelets or earrings, jewelry is extremely popular.
The fact is that jewelry has always been an important part of human cultures, serving several purposes that are deeply significant to each of us.
The great importance of jewelry in women’s life may be explained by the fact that women love jewelry since ages, so it’s something they have inherited…it’s like without jewelry there’s something major missing.
Jewelry is an important ornament for all special occasions a woman goes through in life - like wedding, anniversary, birthday party, the birth of the first child (in some places women receive jewelry from their husband to mark the special event). So, if women didn’t wear jewelry on such special occasions, it would be at least odd, don’t you agree? Jewelry gives women a gorgeous, feminine look and brings out a more confidence, style and beauty.
Jewelry is also one of the best and expensive gifts that a husband can offer to his wife. There is great variety of different jewelry a man can choose from, and it all very much depends on the event he wants to present himself with the gift and on the style he wants to go for and of course the amount of money he is willing to pay; jewelry can be made from expensive as well as from cheap materials, so it’s really up to you.
Jewelry however is not only served for decoration, as it also represents the best investment one can make in his/her life; it serves as best safety in time of emergency as well.

Traditionally, jewelry represents a symbol of prestige, wealth and power. Jewelry has the ability to highlight women’s personality and bring out the best features when wearing the right jewelry for the right occasion.

So, jewelry has a great importance in women’s life because it can make a woman feel special, stylish and beautiful.

is it normal for a 12 year old to have hidden depression?,"I'm so sorry, a lot of young people suffer from teen depression. Some causes may be physical or mental. But the bible tells us at Isaiah 33:24: ""No resident will say, I am sick"". There's a website that I often refer to to help with this question along with others you may need answers to, jw.org. "
,"ANONYMOUS.........THE SYMPTOMS OF TEEN DEPRESSION CAN APPEAR DURING ADOLESCENCE.
WHAT PARENTS CAN DO; 
Recognize that depressed teens may find it hard to express their feelings or may not understand what is happening to them. They may not even be aware of the symptoms of depression.
Teens tend to express their depression in ways different from those of adults, so be alert to major changes in your child’s behavior, eating habits, moods, sleep patterns, or social interactions—especially if the changes persist for weeks.
Take seriously any comments or hints regarding suicide.
If you suspect depression (not just the blues), consider getting a professional diagnosis.
Help your teen adhere to the doctor’s prescribed treatment, and consult the doctor if you see no improvement or observe unpleasant side effects.
Have a stable family routine for eating, exercising, and sleeping.
Maintain good communication with your teen, and help him or her to deal with any stigma associated with depression.
Because depression can make one feel alone, ashamed, or worthless, regularly reassure your teen of your love."
,Depression anybody can suffer from it. There are always telltale signs and would be prudent the person in question not to be left alone.
Its new years day. National hangover day. National blood donors day. So is this your day??????????????????????????,"Happy New Year!
No hangover for me. I do donate blood when I can."
,Happy New Year! No hangover for me. But I did do a double shot of NyQuil for a cold before I went to bed. I donate blood twice a year when the Red Cross puts on a blood drive at our local firehouse.
,"Happy New Year!
I just donated last week so I'm staying in and watching football and maybe play a few slots on playojo. It's the last day of the holiday season before we all go back to work and face another 12 months before yet another holiday season!!
Have fun and good luck to you all."
,"No hang over for me!
Haven't given blood in a while been fighting a vitamin deficiency lately. Maybe I can again soon."
,"No hang over for me... Yang and my daughter?..... Well that's a different story! Lol! I have never donated blood. ?? That's bad I know. Yang on the other hand has a rare blood type so the vampires were after him to donate every year which he did until his pulmonary embolism. Now he has to be on blood thinners. ??
Happy New year to everyone!!!!
It's a great day!"
,"Well, I don't drink so hangover day is out
To donate blood, I'd have to ask my Dr (thyroid prob)
So I guess I'll go with New Years"

,"Hey there! This is a hard question to be honest. So many
artists produced amazing albums and singles. Right now I think it might be
Kendrick Lamar’s Humble. I am not a big fan of the rapper, but the lyrics of this
song just blew my mind the first time I heard it. I have been listening to the
single at least once a day ever since it was released."
,Hi! It will have to be Despacito by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee! The song is popular all over the world and most youngsters know the lyrics by heart even if it’s all in Spanish. I also enjoy the remixed version; it features Justin Bieber and it holds some English bits that make it even better!
,How Far I'll Go

is it normal for a 12 year old to have hidden depression?,"I'm so sorry, a lot of young people suffer from teen depression. Some causes may be physical or mental. But the bible tells us at Isaiah 33:24: ""No resident will say, I am sick"". There's a website that I often refer to to help with this question along with others you may need answers to, jw.org. "
,"ANONYMOUS.........THE SYMPTOMS OF TEEN DEPRESSION CAN APPEAR DURING ADOLESCENCE.
WHAT PARENTS CAN DO; 
Recognize that depressed teens may find it hard to express their feelings or may not understand what is happening to them. They may not even be aware of the symptoms of depression.
Teens tend to express their depression in ways different from those of adults, so be alert to major changes in your child’s behavior, eating habits, moods, sleep patterns, or social interactions—especially if the changes persist for weeks.
Take seriously any comments or hints regarding suicide.
If you suspect depression (not just the blues), consider getting a professional diagnosis.
Help your teen adhere to the doctor’s prescribed treatment, and consult the doctor if you see no improvement or observe unpleasant side effects.
Have a stable family routine for eating, exercising, and sleeping.
Maintain good communication with your teen, and help him or her to deal with any stigma associated with depression.
Because depression can make one feel alone, ashamed, or worthless, regularly reassure your teen of your love."
,Depression anybody can suffer from it. There are always telltale signs and would be prudent the person in question not to be left alone.
I was able to find Otis's question right away! There's not as much spam this morning! What do you think they are up to this new year?,Let's hope they're looking for somewhere else to Spam!!! So they can leave us alone!
,I gave them a glitter bomb

What is your favorite song of 2017?,I'm going with a country western this time .... I love the lyrics.
,Wo men ai qing de gu shi ~ :D
,"Hey there! This is a hard question to be honest. So many
artists produced amazing albums and singles. Right now I think it might be
Kendrick Lamar’s Humble. I am not a big fan of the rapper, but the lyrics of this
song just blew my mind the first time I heard it. I have been listening to the
single at least once a day ever since it was released."
,Hi! It will have to be Despacito by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee! The song is popular all over the world and most youngsters know the lyrics by heart even if it’s all in Spanish. I also enjoy the remixed version; it features Justin Bieber and it holds some English bits that make it even better!
,How Far I'll Go
,"One of my favorite song of 2017 is Luis Fonsi song ""Despacito"". He is a prominent Puerto Rican singer and songwriter who is known best for his worldwide hit song Despacito. Luis Fonsi Despacito featuring Daddy Yankee has charted at number one in US Latin."

What Are The Advantage And Disadvantage Of Public Education?,"The major advantages of public school education are as follows :-

1) Your child is exposed to the maximum number of people which helps them learn to get along with people from different background. This also leads to a greater synergy in terms of diversity as each group bring their own set of unique experiences.

2) Public schools generally follow a standardized curriculum and is calibrated ubiquitously through out the country

3) Public schools are free.

4) Public schools are generally secular in charter as they do not expose the children to religious studies.

The disadvantages of Public schools however are :-

1) There's generally more reported acts of violence in public schools.

2) Individual attention is very rare since they sport bigger classroom with greater number of pupils."

How can a teenager (middle school) lose 20 pounds quickly?,"Uhhh, why would you need that to happen? Don't do anything..."
,"I usually don't respond to these questions but Ill let this time be an occasion.

Despite how convenient it may sound, losing weight ""quickly"" would probably not feel as rewarding for long. More like a short lived impulse that after it happens, turns into a down feeling. If you take the process duration and plan it you will feel happier once you accomplish it. Knowing your planned determination was a result of doing properly (long route) it also builds a sense of control once the results progress.
A lot of people have told me they felt that ""now what"" feeling after quickly rushing off their weight goals like you're talking about. I think if you want to, you can lose 20 pounds. But can you find a way to urgently cheat through it..? Probably not. Im sure its possible though. Maybe you could.
Just don't accept any easy routes as truth. Most of stuff you'll hear online will be lies and unsafe and the other 20% scams. Id say 80% of the methods you will hear online are false.
I have heard a lot of them myself and I have not once tried to lose weight myself! That, Ironically, is why Im warning you. Because with all the bs I have seen then I could only imagine what someone searching for intentionally will find.

Im sure everyone does not agree with me, but this is my advice. Besides of course the ""ask your doctor"" thought response."
,Salads and exercise
,Talk to a doctor!! Please don't do anything dangerous!!!
,Oh my !  Ho did this person gain 20 pounds so quickly?
,"You didn't gain it quickly, so don't expect to lose it quickly.  The proper way is to eat a well balanced, well portioned diet. Stay hydrated and get at least 8 hours of sleep.  Also get 30 minutes of exercise everyday. Just walk. It is free and easy to do. If you don't have 30 minutes at one time, do two 15 minute walks or three 10 minute walks."
,"Create a Calorie deficit.
Figure out what you are consuming daily and reduce it by 200 to 300 calories if you are maintaining weight, and not gaining weight.
Add in at least 10,000 steps a day and you will lose weight. Since you didn't gain it overnight, do not expect to lose it overnight.   "
,"I believe you should focus more on eating healthy and getting proper nutrition than simply losing weight. You will lose weight along the way, which is good, but to strive to eat healthy for the sake of it is more of a lifestyle than a goal. If you tried to just lose weight, then it is likely you will gain it back once you've lost if your goal is a particular destination rather than an overall health habit change. Also, just because you're eating enough to lose doesn't necessarily equate to eating good.
Additionally, it is important to know that even though items may have the same about of calories in them, doesn't mean that they're equally as fattening contrary to popular belief. You actually burn foods like almonds faster than crackers even if you intake the same amount of calories of either.
Also, stay clear of ""diet"" foods. Special ""K"" chips, fat free cookies, etc. They're actually worse for you, and in order to make them ""fat free"" or ""sugar free"" they either have to load in tons of sugar or artificial sweetener, which is the real devil here. Eat some real food and not factory-crap advertised as good for diets.
(Added) Sugar is the biggest perpetrator in obesity. It does not carry nutrients or anything humans need in it, but it is very fattening, addicting, and causes cravings and hunger. In fact, sugar is more addicting than heroin, which can perhaps paint a picture on the extent sugar is what causes cravings and misleading hunger signals, making it detrimental to our health. So try to limit sugar, yet don't get sweets and junk food that is labeled ""sugar free."" They contain artificial sweeteners, which is worse for you even though they don't taste nearly as good."
,"In order to lose wait follow these steps:
Consult with a medical professional
Determine if you actually need to lose weight, and if so, how much
Make sure you’re doing it for the right reasons
Be realistic about losing weight fast
Make your health your priority
Limit restaurant meals
Get plenty of exercises
Drink a lot of water
Stop drinking your calories
Avoid fad diets"
How Do You Pick A Lock ?,"Okay so you neek a pocket knife and a big paper clip.

You bend the paper clip so that there is a straight part on it. You stick that into the top of the lock. If you look you will see little like shelves sort of and you have to make sure all of those are pressed up.Then you take the pocket knife and turn the lock."
,"If the movies are to be believed, all you need is a hair pin which you insert into the lock and then jiggle around for five seconds or so. The, hey presto, the door swings open and you enter with a big grin on your face.

Unfortunately, it's slightly more complicated than that. Indeed, most burglars tend to use brute force rather dexterity to gain entry. More crude battering ram than hair pin, to be honest.

The only people that can successfully pick any kind of secure lock is a locksmith and he will need something called a skeleton key to do so. Or rather a whole bunch of skeletons keys until the lock opens.

In any case, most modern locks are not designed to be easily picked. Not like the days of old when there were certain cars that would start with the key off a corned beef tin."
,"I happened to stumble across this response and just could not resist the opportunity to reply.

I am sorry, but your answer lacks any insight or basic knowledge regarding lock smithing. I guess you have never witnessed a lock smith manipulating a secured lock in lieu of a key. You might be surprised to learn that a lock smith can actually ""pick"" the lock using a ""lock pick"". However, you do not necessarily need to be a lock smith to ""pick"" a lock. With a lot of patience and considerable practice, anyone can learn to pick a lock without the formal training received by the lock smith.

In some cases, the associated tools of the trade may not be required. For instance, given the scenario, the only tool that may be needed is a credit card. Using a credit card, however, to compress the locking mechanism would not technically be considered ""picking the lock"" but rather deemed ""breaking and entering""."
,"You can pick a lock from locksmith firm. For this you just need to look for a locksmith company online and see the feedback they have got. You can even simply search for ""locksmith in San Francisco""."
,You can pick a lock from Eagle Locksmith.
,You can pick lock from Eagle Locksmith.
,Legallly.
,"Lock picking is defined as the manipulation of a lock's components to open the lock without a normal key. Therefore to pick a lock successfully one must understand the principles of both lock and key. A standard deadbolt lock consists of pins tumblers that are rotated by the key to open the lock. Most locks are similar in concept so learning this method of lock picking will serve you well. 

Buy a practice lock. Get a standard five-pin deadbolt lock that can be disassembled. 
Remove all but the first pin closest to the front of the lock.
The way to pick a door lock is by maneuvering the pin tumblers to the sheer line. The sheer line is a mechanism of measurement that tells the lock it is okay to open. As a key lifts the first pin it tumbles into its sheer line groove, the key is already entering the gap of the second pin, and so on.
Fashion the pick tool. Pick tools can be made from a straightened paperclip, the flat end of a hairpin, or a tiny flathead screwdriver. They can also be fashioned out of straight or safety pins, or an industrial staple.
Turn the lock upside down and watch as gravity pulls the pin down. This shows where to insert the pick and apply gentle pressure downward. When you hit the sheer line, the plug will turn and the student will know the feel and pressure needed to release a pin. Turn the lock right side up and practice.
Once the one pin has been mastered, add another pin back into the lock. Close the lock and try again. If the first pin is not released, the second pin cannot be engaged. Keep practicing and adding pins until all five are back in the lock.
With concentrated focus on the lock picking, mastery of this technique can take as little as an hour.  The more pins that a lock has, the sturdier the pick will need to be.

One never knows where and when a lock will need to be picked.  However, mastering the art of lock picking may get an individual back into their own car or home without incurring the expense of calling a locksmith."
,You can borrow a new one from the mother.
,The BEST way is to use a key
,No no no the best way its to cut it off or my Fave use a shot gun!!! BAM! But note you will not see the lock anymore...
,Just Buy a pocket knife and get a paper clip put the paper on the top part of the lock and the pocket knife in the bottom part
Difference between Multiverse and parallel universes?,"""Multiverse"" is correct ... As ""universe"" means there is only one, so there can't be parallel universes.  There can be parallel multiverses, but that is redundant phrasing.  Unless there are intersecting multiverses."
,"Not really a simple answer for this one.
These quotes come from the physic stack exchange and from
www.dummies.com/education/science/physics/string-theory-para
In string theory, the multiverse is a theory in which our universe is not the only one; many universes exist parallel to each other. These distinct universes within the multiverse theory are called parallel universes.
“Parallel universes “ is a description of the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics."

How Much Does It Cost To Get Beyonce At My Party?,About 100.00 dollars
,It depends who you are and were your from(travel plans)
,I had beyonce at my party yes it was very expensive
,Its about 2-3 million $.
,"Whether you want a slow dance with Justin Bieber or a twerk with Miley
Cyrus - these are the mind-blowing appearance fees that your favorite
A-listers charge to turn up at your party.
The last solid figure we could find for an appearance from Biebs himself
was a MILLION dollars... But with a horde of newly converted Beliebers
spanning the globe, we're sure he's charging much more in his 'Purpose'
days!
Yes, you read that right... 8 MILLION DOLLARS! That's the price
Westfield paid her to switch on the Christmas lights at their mall in
Stratford, East London, back in 2012. If you want RiRi to flick the
switch on your fairy lights at home, you'd better start saving!
He might be taking his sweet time releasing his third album, but in the
meantime you can expect to fork out $1.5million to get a live rendition
of 'Uptown Funk' at your nan's 80th next month - but we're sure she'll
love you even if you can't get the 'Treasure' superstar down the local
Working Men's Club.
Looking to book Beyoncé for a corporate event, private party, fundraiser orpublic event worldwide? Sugar Sand Sound makes it easy and trouble free to check availability and pricing for booking Beyoncé or any other act in the business with absolutely no obligations. If we don't book an act for you, our service is free."
,"Lots and Lots of money $500,000 at least and I think that is only for 20 minutes"
,I am trying to book beyonce to a party and the agent I chose stated that the price to book beyonce is 1 million dollars.
,"Get a Black man..Dress him up as a girl...Teach him to lipsinc...
Hired black man=30 Dollars
Sexy Girl Clothes=100+ Dollars
Lipsinc Lessons=50 Dollars
Peoples Reactions=Priceless"
,"For a 20 minute performance by Beyonce its going to cost you $500,000.00

Also, remember its hard to get a Celebrity to come to your party if there is no media coverage. So if your going to have someone famous come to your party, contact MTV and go on their show Sweet 16!"
,"1,000,000.000$"
,"Id depends how much money you can give her, Which she's worth more than Tom Cruise's house, and that's like, BILLIONS of dollars, Which is sad, because I'd rather have Lady Gaga at my party, Not Beyonce or Mrs. J-Lo. :]"
,Way way way more then 10 thousand 600 thousand at best but  their has been speacalations that she does party for 5 millions but its 100% not 10k a celebrity DJ eg samamntha ronson is 28 thousand
,"Well beyonce is one of the bigest stars today  and well everyone is asking her to perform privet parties just like you and beyonce will only perform at the party that pais her the most and the price it would probely be is about...$10,000 my dad paid about $9,000 for her to come to my party but that was a year ago and the price is rising if you are from britain(like me)you will have to transfer your pounds to dollars becuse beyonce aint got enough time in her busy life so does that answer your question"
,It may be a bit expensive
,2million dollars

I don't think you're ready to be having any sex until you understand the basics of human biology. How old are you???"
,"First of all I will suggest you to take pregnancy test . It very easy go to any medicine store [ pharmacy] and buy a pregnancy test gadget and test own your own. There must be a manual guide to learn more how to use .
And second as you said you're a girl and you had sex with your girlfriend that's mean she is girl too. So there is no possibility to get pregnant . Why there is no chance ? Because an pregnancy ussaly happened after a sex with a male . Becuase
Getting pregnant (conception) happens when a man’s sperm fertilises a woman’s egg. Read more
So I think there is no chance .
If you feel sick you must take some medicine and for sure must visit a doctor . I think its your health disorder there is nothing to do having sex with your gf and those are not a pregnancy symptoms."
"I'm 16, female. Wondering if I have some health problem because I missed my period (first time ever) I'm more tired recently and have a loss of appetite.

,"Essay writing structure
Composing an academic essay entails fashioning a coherent pair of ideas to a debate. Due to the fact essays are essentially linear--they feature one idea at a period--they should show their thoughts in the arrangement which makes most sense into an individual reader. Properly structuring an essay signifies attending into a reader's logic.
The focus of this kind of essay predicts its arrangement. It dictates that the advice readers will need to know and the arrangement where they will need to receive it. So your article's structure is fundamentally unique for the most important claim you're earning. Although you can find guidelines for building certain traditional essay types (e.g., comparative analysis), there are no set system.
Answering Inquiries: The Sections of a Essay
A common article has various sorts of advice, frequently situated in technical components or segments. Even limited essays function a number of different surgeries: Introducing the debate, analyzing data, increasing counter-arguments, concluding. Introductions and decisions have mended places, however, other parts do not. Counterargument, for example, can happen within just a paragraph, either being a freestanding segment, as part of the onset, or even before the end. Background materials (historical context or biographical info, a summary of appropriate criticism or theory, this is of a essential term) usually appears in the beginning of the essay, between your debut and also the first analytical department, but may possibly also appear near the start of the specific portion to which it truly is related.
It is helpful to consider about those different essay segments as answering a succession of questions that your reader might ask when restricting your thesis. (Readers have to have queries. Should they don't, the thesis is the most likely only an observation of reality, maybe not an arguable claim.)
""What?"" The very first question to anticipate from your reader would be ""what"": What signs proves the phenomenon clarified by your thesis is true? To answer this question you must examine your evidence, so demonstrating the truth of one's claim. This really ""exactly what"" or ""demonstration"" part includes early in this essay, often shortly after this debut. As you're in essence reporting exactly what you've seen, here could be the area you've got to say about when you begin producing. But you have to be forewarned: It willn't take up much more compared to a third (usually much less) of the finished essay. Should it, the article may lack equilibrium and could see as mere summary or description.
""How?"" A reader may also desire to understand if the claims of this thesis are authentic in all situations. The corresponding challenge would be ""how"": Just how can the thesis stand until the challenge of a counterargument? Exactly how does the introduction of new stuff--a brand new direction of looking at the signs, yet another set of sources--affect that the claims you are making? On average, an article will probably comprise atleast ""how"" area. (phone it ""complication"" as you're responding to a reader's complicating questions) This section usually arrives after the ""what,"" but keep in your mind that an article may reevaluate its debate a couple times depending on its span, and that counter argument alone could appear almost everywhere within a essay.
Your writer will also want to know what is at stake on your claim: Why can your interpretation of the phenomenon thing to anybody beside you personally? This question covers the larger consequences of one's thesis. It enables your audience to comprehend your own essay in just a bigger context. In answering ""why"", your essay explains a unique significance. Although you could gesture in this question in the introduction, the fullest reply to this comes at your essay's conclude. If you abandon it out, your subscribers may experience your essay too incomplete--or worse, even as moot or insular.
Mapping an Essay
Structuring your essay according to a reader logic means assessing your thesis along with trusting exactly what your reader needs to learn, and in what arrangement, as a way to comprehend and be convinced from your debate because it evolves. Easy and simple way to do so is to map the article's notions with a published story. Such an account can provide you a preliminary list of your thoughts, and enable one to remind yourself in every turn of the reader's needs in understanding your thought.
Essay maps request that you predict where your reader may expect background information, counter argument, close identification of the main source, or an alternate twist to secondary origin stuff. Composing maps aren't worried about paragraphs so muchas having sections within an essay writing. They expect the key argumentative moves you expect your composition to generate. Try making your map such as that:
    Condition your thesis at a sentence or 2, then compose a second sentence expressing why it is vital to create certain assert. Indicate, to put it differently, what a reader could know by researching the claim with you. Here you are expecting your answer to this ""why"" issue you will finally flesh out in your conclusion.
    Begin your next sentence like that: ""To be convinced with my own argue, very first thing that a reader should understand is ..."" Then say why this is very first thing a reader needs to know, and title a couple of items of evidence which you think will produce the situation. This will start off you on answering the ""what"" issue. (alternatively, you can come to realize that very first thing your reader has to understand is a few background details.)
    Start every one of the subsequent sentences like this: ""Next thing my reader needs to learn is why ..."" Once again, state, and then name some evidence. Continue till you have mapped out on that your own essay.
Your map should naturally take you as a result of several preliminary responses to the standard questions about what, how, and the reason why. It is not a contract, even nevertheless--that the arrangement in which the ideas appear isn't just a stiff one. Composing maps are elastic; nevertheless they develop along with your thoughts.
Signals of Difficulty
A common structural flaw in college essays is that the ""walkthrough"" (also labeled ""summary"" or ""outline""). Walkthrough essays follow the structure of the sources rather than establishing their particular personal. Such essays generally have a descriptive thesis as opposed to an 1. Be skeptical of paragraph openers that lead off with ""time"" phrases (""original,"" ""next,"" ""afterwards,"" ""afterward"") or even ""listing"" words (""too,"" ""a second,"" ""also""). Even though they don't necessarily indicate trouble, these paragraph timers usually indicate that a composition's thesis and structure require function: They imply that the composition only imitates the chronology of this source text (at the case of keywords: First this comes to pass, then, and later another thing ... ) or lists example after example (""Additionally the use of color signals another manner which the painting differentiates between nice and wicked"")."
,"A clear introduction with a well defined structure, Logically structured body paragraphs which include supporting evidence from academic sources. A clear conclusion which restates your topic and summarizes your essay and thesis.
A basic essay consists of three main parts: Introduction, body, and conclusion. Following this format will help you write and organize an essay. However, flexibility is important. While keeping this basic essay format in mind, let the topic and specific assignment guide the writing and organization.
Parts of an Essay
Introduction : The introduction guides your reader into the paper by introducing the topic. It should
begin with a hook that catches the reader’s interest.
Thesis Statement:
The thesis statement concisely states the main idea or argument of the essay, sets
limits on the topic, and can indicate the organization of the essay.
Body :
The body of the essay supports the main points presented in the thesis. Each point is
developed by one or more paragraphs and supported with specific details. These
details can include support from research and experiences, depending on the
assignment.
Transitions
Transitions connect paragraphs to each other and to the thesis. They are used within and between
paragraphs to help the paper flow from one topic to the next. These transitions can be one or two words
(“first,” “next,” “in addition,” etc.) or one or two sentences that bring the reader to the next main point.
Conclusion
The conclusion brings together all the main points of the essay. It refers back to the thesis statement
and leaves readers with a final thought and sense of closure by resolving any ideas brought up in the
essay. It may also address the implications of the argument. In the conclusion, new topics or ideas that
were not developed in the paper should not be introduced.
Citations
If your paper incorporates research, be sure to give credit to each source using in-text citations and a
Works Cited/References/Bibliography page. Refer to the MLA Format, APA Format, or Turabian Format

Difference between Multiverse and parallel universes?,"""Multiverse"" is correct ... As ""universe"" means there is only one, so there can't be parallel universes.  There can be parallel multiverses, but that is redundant phrasing.  Unless there are intersecting multiverses."

Difference between Multiverse and parallel universes?,"""Multiverse"" is correct ... As ""universe"" means there is only one, so there can't be parallel universes.  There can be parallel multiverses, but that is redundant phrasing.  Unless there are intersecting multiverses."
,"Not really a simple answer for this one.
These quotes come from the physic stack exchange and from
www.dummies.com/education/science/physics/string-theory-para
In string theory, the multiverse is a theory in which our universe is not the only one; many universes exist parallel to each other. These distinct universes within the multiverse theory are called parallel universes.
“Parallel universes “ is a description of the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics."
What can I do to make my hair less greasy?,Try changing brands of shampoo and conditioner. Certain ones just don't work for my hair. Also (for me) it can depend on the time of year. Like right now (the start of winter) my hair is so dry. Even though it's the same shampoo and conditioner I use for summer.
,"I have a seemingly counterintuitive suggestion: Of course if you’re not shampooing regularly already, you should shampoo more often.
However, if you ARE shampooing regularly, and it’s not working, I would suggest trying to CUT DOWN on shampooing. Shampooing strips hair of natural oils, and your scalp may produce more and more as a result.
Search up “no -poo”, there communities of people doing this and it works for them. Might not work for everyone.
Also, use dry shampoo!!! Basically it’s alcohol and powder in a aerosol can. Spray it in your hair, wait 3 minutes, then comb it all out. It rids all the oil and germs. There’s even dark dry shampoo for dark hair! (Lol I discovered it just this month and it’s really improved my hair situation.) If it works good on my long hair, I can imagine it’ll work even better for shorter hair.
If your hair gets too dry, take a tiny bit of coconut oil and comb that over the ends of your hair (not the scalp). Wash every other day, or if you sweat/get dirty. Otherwise, shower but put on a shower cap (or a walmart bag like i do...it’s very loud though)."
,Don't put grease?
,Shampoo often.  Use a shampoo designed to improve oily hair .... Almost every brand has a selection like that.

How Do You Pick A Lock ?,"Okay so you neek a pocket knife and a big paper clip.

You bend the paper clip so that there is a straight part on it. You stick that into the top of the lock. If you look you will see little like shelves sort of and you have to make sure all of those are pressed up.Then you take the pocket knife and turn the lock."
,"If the movies are to be believed, all you need is a hair pin which you insert into the lock and then jiggle around for five seconds or so. The, hey presto, the door swings open and you enter with a big grin on your face.

Unfortunately, it's slightly more complicated than that. Indeed, most burglars tend to use brute force rather dexterity to gain entry. More crude battering ram than hair pin, to be honest.

The only people that can successfully pick any kind of secure lock is a locksmith and he will need something called a skeleton key to do so. Or rather a whole bunch of skeletons keys until the lock opens.

In any case, most modern locks are not designed to be easily picked. Not like the days of old when there were certain cars that would start with the key off a corned beef tin."
,"I happened to stumble across this response and just could not resist the opportunity to reply.

I am sorry, but your answer lacks any insight or basic knowledge regarding lock smithing. I guess you have never witnessed a lock smith manipulating a secured lock in lieu of a key. You might be surprised to learn that a lock smith can actually ""pick"" the lock using a ""lock pick"". However, you do not necessarily need to be a lock smith to ""pick"" a lock. With a lot of patience and considerable practice, anyone can learn to pick a lock without the formal training received by the lock smith.

In some cases, the associated tools of the trade may not be required. For instance, given the scenario, the only tool that may be needed is a credit card. Using a credit card, however, to compress the locking mechanism would not technically be considered ""picking the lock"" but rather deemed ""breaking and entering""."
,"You can pick a lock from locksmith firm. For this you just need to look for a locksmith company online and see the feedback they have got. You can even simply search for ""locksmith in San Francisco""."
,You can pick a lock from Eagle Locksmith.

,"Lock picking is defined as the manipulation of a lock's components to open the lock without a normal key. Therefore to pick a lock successfully one must understand the principles of both lock and key. A standard deadbolt lock consists of pins tumblers that are rotated by the key to open the lock. Most locks are similar in concept so learning this method of lock picking will serve you well. 

Buy a practice lock. Get a standard five-pin deadbolt lock that can be disassembled. 
Remove all but the first pin closest to the front of the lock.
The way to pick a door lock is by maneuvering the pin tumblers to the sheer line. The sheer line is a mechanism of measurement that tells the lock it is okay to open. As a key lifts the first pin it tumbles into its sheer line groove, the key is already entering the gap of the second pin, and so on.
Fashion the pick tool. Pick tools can be made from a straightened paperclip, the flat end of a hairpin, or a tiny flathead screwdriver. They can also be fashioned out of straight or safety pins, or an industrial staple.
Turn the lock upside down and watch as gravity pulls the pin down. This shows where to insert the pick and apply gentle pressure downward. When you hit the sheer line, the plug will turn and the student will know the feel and pressure needed to release a pin. Turn the lock right side up and practice.
Once the one pin has been mastered, add another pin back into the lock. Close the lock and try again. If the first pin is not released, the second pin cannot be engaged. Keep practicing and adding pins until all five are back in the lock.
With concentrated focus on the lock picking, mastery of this technique can take as little as an hour.  The more pins that a lock has, the sturdier the pick will need to be.

One never knows where and when a lock will need to be picked.  However, mastering the art of lock picking may get an individual back into their own car or home without incurring the expense of calling a locksmith."

How can a teenager (middle school) lose 20 pounds quickly?,"Uhhh, why would you need that to happen? Don't do anything..."
,"I usually don't respond to these questions but Ill let this time be an occasion.

Despite how convenient it may sound, losing weight ""quickly"" would probably not feel as rewarding for long. More like a short lived impulse that after it happens, turns into a down feeling. If you take the process duration and plan it you will feel happier once you accomplish it. Knowing your planned determination was a result of doing properly (long route) it also builds a sense of control once the results progress.
A lot of people have told me they felt that ""now what"" feeling after quickly rushing off their weight goals like you're talking about. I think if you want to, you can lose 20 pounds. But can you find a way to urgently cheat through it..? Probably not. Im sure its possible though. Maybe you could.
Just don't accept any easy routes as truth. Most of stuff you'll hear online will be lies and unsafe and the other 20% scams. Id say 80% of the methods you will hear online are false.
I have heard a lot of them myself and I have not once tried to lose weight myself! That, Ironically, is why Im warning you. Because with all the bs I have seen then I could only imagine what someone searching for intentionally will find.

Im sure everyone does not agree with me, but this is my advice. Besides of course the ""ask your doctor"" thought response."
,Salads and exercise
,Talk to a doctor!! Please don't do anything dangerous!!!
,Oh my !  Ho did this person gain 20 pounds so quickly?
,"You didn't gain it quickly, so don't expect to lose it quickly.  The proper way is to eat a well balanced, well portioned diet. Stay hydrated and get at least 8 hours of sleep.  Also get 30 minutes of exercise everyday. Just walk. It is free and easy to do. If you don't have 30 minutes at one time, do two 15 minute walks or three 10 minute walks."
,"Create a Calorie deficit.
Figure out what you are consuming daily and reduce it by 200 to 300 calories if you are maintaining weight, and not gaining weight.
Add in at least 10,000 steps a day and you will lose weight. Since you didn't gain it overnight, do not expect to lose it overnight.   "
,"I believe you should focus more on eating healthy and getting proper nutrition than simply losing weight. You will lose weight along the way, which is good, but to strive to eat healthy for the sake of it is more of a lifestyle than a goal. If you tried to just lose weight, then it is likely you will gain it back once you've lost if your goal is a particular destination rather than an overall health habit change. Also, just because you're eating enough to lose doesn't necessarily equate to eating good.
Additionally, it is important to know that even though items may have the same about of calories in them, doesn't mean that they're equally as fattening contrary to popular belief. You actually burn foods like almonds faster than crackers even if you intake the same amount of calories of either.
Also, stay clear of ""diet"" foods. Special ""K"" chips, fat free cookies, etc. They're actually worse for you, and in order to make them ""fat free"" or ""sugar free"" they either have to load in tons of sugar or artificial sweetener, which is the real devil here. Eat some real food and not factory-crap advertised as good for diets.
(Added) Sugar is the biggest perpetrator in obesity. It does not carry nutrients or anything humans need in it, but it is very fattening, addicting, and causes cravings and hunger. In fact, sugar is more addicting than heroin, which can perhaps paint a picture on the extent sugar is what causes cravings and misleading hunger signals, making it detrimental to our health. So try to limit sugar, yet don't get sweets and junk food that is labeled ""sugar free."" They contain artificial sweeteners, which is worse for you even though they don't taste nearly as good."
,"In order to lose wait follow these steps:
Consult with a medical professional
Determine if you actually need to lose weight, and if so, how much
Make sure you’re doing it for the right reasons
Be realistic about losing weight fast
Make your health your priority
Limit restaurant meals
Get plenty of exercises
Drink a lot of water
Stop drinking your calories
Avoid fad diets"

How Do I Wish A Girl A Happy Birthday In French?,"""Happy birthday"" is actually the same for a girl and a boy in French - the word ""anniversaire"" is always masculine, so its modifier - the ""happy"" part - is too.

There are two possible ways of saying ""happy birthday"" in French:
Joyeux anniversaire!
Bon anniversaire!
These two are totally interchangeable, so it doesn't matter which you use. Quite often, when wishing somebody happy birthday online or in a text message, people will just write ""bon anniv,"" which is just an abbreviation of ""bon anniversaire.""

Other Birthday-Related Phrases in French
Mon anniversaire - My birthday
Un gâteau d'anniversaire - A birthday cake

How To Say 'Birthday Greetings' In Italian?,"To send someone your birthday greetings in Italian, you only really need one word: Auguri!

This word is the shortened version of the slightly more laborious auguri di buon compleanno.

The word auguri comes from the verb augurare which means 'to wish'- so the closest English expression would probably be something like 'best wishes'.

Like the term 'best wishes', auguri is not limited to use for birthdays. Instead, it is used at various occasions in Italian and is often the first word you'll hear at the chime of midnight when people are welcoming in a new year.

If you want to extend birthday greetings especially fervently, you may want to modify auguri with the superlatve suffix -oni. In Italian, this suffix is used to denote great size, so auguroni would be the word for 'great big birthday wishes'.

Alternatively, you could use the indefinite adjective tanti meaning 'many' to say tanti auguri.
The expression tanti auguri is also the title of the Italian song 'happy birthday' and is a phrase that often decorates birthday cards and banners that you might buy at the local cartoleria or 'stationery shop'..

One final option is to simply say buon compelanno meaning 'happy birthday'- the main thing is to remember to say something!

What Are The Advantages And Disadvantages Of A Private Education?,"A private education can have many advantages.
Private education offers the chance for a child to grow in terms of personal development and confidence.
Many private schools are highly academic and are ideal for a motivated, academic student. However many private schools are less academically focused and aim to provide a good all round education for children on a variety of levels rather than being purely academic.
State schools are not always in good catchment areas and private education can ensure that the majority of the classes are full of motivated pupils in many cases.
Personal development is highly valued and children get more individual attention in the private sector.
The downside is that students at private schools do not mix with a wide mixture of other children from different backgrounds and may have a narrower perspective on a range of social issues. Conversely some may argue that this is a positive in favour of the private sector.
One disadvantage which is a major one is cost. Many parents and children are at a disadvantage because of the cost of fees which are usually very high - the present Labour Government withdrew assisted place funding which benefited many gifted children.
There are some scholarships and bursaries available but the competition for them is high."
,Advantages And Disadvantages Of A Private Education
,Disadvantages of private schools in Nigeria
,"Positives:
Small class sizes.
Impressive test scores (not always, though).
A wider variety of extra-curricular on-site opportunities (not always)
A smaller tightly knit school community.
Not necessarily tied to the National Curriculum (some independent schools follow it, anyway).
Not required to sit SATs.

Negatives:
High cost (for most a consideration!).

""Keeping up with the Jones'"": if your child's classmates are wealthy and manifest that wealth, will your child feel left out if your family doesn't have as much money?

Many private schools do not require their teachers to have the same level of achievement or accreditation as is required in the state sector.

Cultural or social isolation: your child will probably a larger range of other types of people in a state school.

Being tapped for money: if you thought the state sector schools are always fund-raising, that's not a patch on the work that private schools have to do to get extra money in.

Can be bad or good
Hot-housing: not an issue everywhere, but do you want your child in an environment with high academic expectations? What if that's not what they're like?

,"If your aim is to improve your aptitude and knowledge base in a particular field, all education pertaining to this subject will useful. If this statement is assumed true, then the benefits afforded by private tuition are enormous. You will have the advantage of a whole teacher to yourself, with their lesson plans and strategies of teaching designed just for you! It seems impossible to doubt the enormous benefits this will offer. In a classroom, one teacher may be faced with around thirty pupils, each with different abilities, different rates of learning, and individual strengths and weaknesses; yet despite this, for the majority of the lesson the teacher will be forced to treat his class as if it contained just one student. He or she will orate from one end of the classroom, unable to gauge how effectively each pupil is assimilating the lesson. The lesson plans will be designed to fit the needs of the average pupil; and the teacher will proceed at a rate suitable for the average pupil.
In this environment it is all to easy for a bright child or adolescent to fail to grasp one particular point, as the swathe of teacher talk washes over them like the unrelenting tides. It is unlikely even the best of teachers would spot the particular point of misunderstanding cast on the countenance on one pupil, hidden amongst so many other faces. To draw attention to their lack of understanding can be intimidating for the pupil: Everyone else is silent, so they must have understood. Do I want to draw attention to myself? All too often the misunderstanding goes unexpressed and unaided. The obvious benefit of one to one tuition is that the tutor can tailor their teaching style to the abilities of their student. They will be able to gauge the level of the pupils understanding, and, more importantly, track down the sources of misunderstanding, and deal with them effectively. Away from the bustle of the classroom, the student will feel more able to voice their difficulties; and having just one pupil to deal with, the teacher will be more capable of resolving them.
Compared to the conflicts of the classroom, fraught with distractions and intimidations from other pupils, the relaxed environment of tutor and student can be a safe haven of erudition. Most tutors will be willing to travel to the pupil's house, allowing them the benefit of learning in a happy home location.A tutor will be able to focus their teaching on a particular area: The pupil may be very competent in mathematics overall, but be deficient in calculus, with this specific weakness undermining their whole confidence in the subject. Maybe they are highly literate and proficient in English language, but shy away from public speaking. The syllabus may demand some oral work (foreign languages certainly do), so it would be a shame if this particular and minor deficiency detracted from their overall grade in the subject. Even if the pupil is performing well at school or college, it is highly likely that some private tuition will give then the edge over their peers. For it is their friends and contemporaries that they are competing against - many of whomay already be receiving tuition. In an age where extra tuition is almost becoming the norm, it may be necessary to join in, or risk being left behind. "

I would only recommend you to this certain female hacker I met on the deep web for those that won't have the previlege or time to access the deep web.

,"At this stage of the game, it doesn’t really matter whether or not he’s cheating or she is cheating. You suspect that he/she is. Whether you’re right or wrong about that, you clearly don’t trust him/ her .So the lack of evidence proves nothing to you.Then, you’ll conclude that he’s even craftier than you thought, and he’s covering up too well to get caught.....

People I know, cheaters I know react to their partners ' accusations by cheating on them even more. So...be sure of it, have proof because as soon as you say something about it, and it happens to not be true...it is going to change the relationship. BUT if you have good reasons and maybe even proof, it would make the relationship come into the light of what it really is. The change was already brought in by him/her and not you in that situation.
Good luck

How many teenager's father's walk around their house wearing nothing but a towel? With a thirteen year old daughter alone with him?,"I don't know a lot of thirteen year olds right now but I never knew dads like that. Maybe he feels okay with it around you because your family and/or home is where he believes he can do things like that because he feels secure there and/or he is your general weirdo. It could be a general male thing like, ""I can do whatever I want because I am a man!"". In other words, lazy.

Does he do it when your mother is at home? If not, talk about it with your mother because some dads get angry. Why? Because in their mind, it's logical to get mad at this because you're being disrespectful and this and that and blah blah blah.

If your dad is not a creeper or a mean dude, then ask him not to do that around you in a sort of scared child manner. Say you are really uncomfortable about it. Remember to say it nicely and not accusatory or in a negative manner. Say it with confusion. That usually works when my stubborn dad won't listen to me.

If both parents are unreasonable and won't be able to understand that you want him to stop walking around the house in only a towel, you're going to have to deal with it. Sorry but just ignore it and everything else, because there'll be more later on.  I know it sounds unfair but you're going to have to be the best of what humanity has to offer while your parents are not. Just concentrate on college, financial stability, and friends. Live a happy life. Peace! :3"
,"Nope  that  is  not  normal  for  any  dad  to do  I  am sorry  but  he  is  not showing no respect   at  all  and  He  could  be  having  other thoughts  in  his  head , You need  to tell  someone  "
,"My dad walks around naked all the time. My stepmom doesn't think it's weird because he's done this as long as I can remember. I'm 13 now, and a girl, but my dad doesn't care. I just try to ignore it, especially when he gets boners or takes a shower with me."
,"A lot of men do that, and at least he's wearing a towel and not nothing I guess it's because most men are quite open with themselves being naked around there house it's sort of like an ""alpha thing"""
"When you chat with someone online ( friend ) , how long do you drag the conversation? Hours? Days? Because I don't know how to become ' close' with my friend (guy) & i wanna become sociable.","I do little short bursts. Maybe with a closer friend, you could drag it out that long (you mean start talking randomly and not establishing an end right?) but usually you ask them about something, then follow with a little chat. If they seem uninterested, maybe check the topic? Or you could end it with an “I’m going to sleep now, ttyl”
End it when you feel like you have to end it."
,Why would you want to drag out a conversation? Just talk to the person for a bit and come back later.  Most people get bored over chit chat.

"Alic-ins Life Insurance Was Purchased From Sears Years Ago. Can You Tell Me If It Is Term, Whole Life Or Accident Only?","It is probably just accident only cover, but it will do no harm to double check if you are unsure what type of policy you have.

Have a look at the small print and Terms & Conditions document you would have been given at the time of opening the life insurance policy. There should be some kind of indication that can tell if you if the policy is Term, Whole Life or Accident Cover.

You should also been in receipt of regular company literature or statements from your policy provider. Scan any letters with a fine tooth and look for any clues about the type of policy you hold. If there is a contact telephone number or an advisor named in the letter in the event you need to get in touch; try to get hold of them. There should also be a policy document number that you may need to quote when making any correspondence.

If you still cannot find any information, the best thing to do is to get in touch with Allicins Life Insurance. If they are unable to help they may direct you to speak to Sears Insurance.

Here are the following contact details you may need when getting in touch with Sears:

www.searsinsurance.info/contactus.php- Fill out an online form giving as much information as possible and someone will get back to you. There is also a contact telephone number if you prefer that approach."

,"It's accidental death and dismemberment insurance, originally issued by Allstate through Sears. The phone number that appears on my bill is 800-736-2242. I tried calling the number. The automated voice that answers says welcome to Allstate Insurance administered by the American Health and Life Insurance Company. The first time I was on hold for 90 minutes before I had to hang up. Now when I call, it disconnects me right after I select the menu option to discontinue enrollment. I found a number online for American Health and Life Insurance (800-316-5607), but they're currently closed for the weekend."
,WHERE CAN I GET A COPY OF MY POLICY?
,Copy of insurance policy
,"I would like to advise you to study life insurance more thoroughly. More information about this you can find, for example, on this site www.americaninsurance.com/ . Most importantly, it does not need to rush into a decision. Good luck."
,"I have Alicins accidental insurance.   I cannot find any info on this and do not have any papers.   Cannot find out who to contact about this policy.   Everyone I contact says to call someone else.   Help, who do I contact to get a copy of the policy or to cancel...."

Hi I'm a 12 year old boy and my bf is 14. We're bi. And we want to have sex but I'm scared and don't know what to do. What should I do?,"Scared?
Then don't have sex because you are not ready."
,"Woah! Not cool. You guys are way too young for sex. I dunno what the law is like where you live, but most places it is downright illegal to have sex at that age. Just wait."
,At 12 years old you should not be thinking of having sex with anybody I have to think the 14 year old boyfriend is pressuring you to do this.  It is against the law and you could both end up in trouble.  It's against the law for a reason and that's because you're still a child and not ready to make these decisions yet.  Please listen to the advice you've got here because you're going to get really messed up if you give in to this.
,"I mean, if you wnat to then you want to but you should probably be alone together and in a goooood spot. Closets work well (kay, maybe not, but you gotta admit nobody will see you)"
,"If you are scared then you are not ready.
At least one of the two of you have the sense to have condoms and know how to safely use them...I hope."
,Well...of course you are scared and you should be. Your bf should even be more afraid. Him getting caught having sex with you can get him arrested and ending up on a sexual predator list. You are entirely too young to be making such a decision. Not to mention the risks.  There are STDs. If you should get one then you hace to tell someone so you can get treated. You are not even a teenager yet. You cannot get medical attention without a parent or guardian. You need to wait.

Does it seem to anyone else that too many of the rising younger generation are doing nothing of real value in their lives?,"I think so.
I never see a teenager without a phone in their hand.
I never see children playing.
Most of them can't carry on a conversation with you."
,Yes this generation has it all mixed up. Everything is on the computer
What can I do to make my hair less greasy?,Try changing brands of shampoo and conditioner. Certain ones just don't work for my hair. Also (for me) it can depend on the time of year. Like right now (the start of winter) my hair is so dry. Even though it's the same shampoo and conditioner I use for summer.
,"I have a seemingly counterintuitive suggestion: Of course if you’re not shampooing regularly already, you should shampoo more often.
However, if you ARE shampooing regularly, and it’s not working, I would suggest trying to CUT DOWN on shampooing. Shampooing strips hair of natural oils, and your scalp may produce more and more as a result.
Search up “no -poo”, there communities of people doing this and it works for them. Might not work for everyone.
Also, use dry shampoo!!! Basically it’s alcohol and powder in a aerosol can. Spray it in your hair, wait 3 minutes, then comb it all out. It rids all the oil and germs. There’s even dark dry shampoo for dark hair! (Lol I discovered it just this month and it’s really improved my hair situation.) If it works good on my long hair, I can imagine it’ll work even better for shorter hair.
If your hair gets too dry, take a tiny bit of coconut oil and comb that over the ends of your hair (not the scalp). Wash every other day, or if you sweat/get dirty. Otherwise, shower but put on a shower cap (or a walmart bag like i do...it’s very loud though)."
,Don't put grease?
,Shampoo often.  Use a shampoo designed to improve oily hair .... Almost every brand has a selection like that.

Its national fruitcake day. Do u lile a good fruit cake??????????????????,"No no no  not me!
But I do have a fruit cake cookie recipe that's wonderful!!"
,i don't mind fruit cake but its not my fave.
,"I don't know anyone who actually likes fruitcake, so people need to stop sending it as a gift lol"
,"I don't like all fruitcake, but I love one made with macadamia nuts and pineapple.  That's enough to make me celebrate!  (Maybe a little shine is in order, Otis.)"
,"I make an awesome fruitcake but the fruit additions take 30 days and alot of daily stirring. Tastes a little boozy and is quite expensive to make taking alot of nuts 18 eggs and a whole bunch of pudding-in-the-mix cake mixes.
Perhaps next year."
,I tried one before... It wasn't horrible but I certainly would rather kill my diet with a piece of chocolate or pie. Lol!
,I didn't know there was such a thing as a good fruitcake.
,"I am a fruitcake, but I don't particularly enjoy eating it."
"My ear's been blocked with wax all day, how can I unblock it?","U can buy over the counter ear wax drops.
U could try warming a small dish, wrapping a towel around it and lay with the blocked ear on it. Sometimes the gentle heat ( with a massage ) can help loosen the wax and help the water and wax drain out."
,Are you sure it is wax and not sinus pressure? Take the hottest shower you can stand. Breathe in the steam. After you get out blow your nose. If that relieves the pressure it is a sinus pressure and start taking something for ypur sinuses.
Hi I'm a 12 year old boy and my bf is 14. We're bi. And we want to have sex but I'm scared and don't know what to do. What should I do?,"Scared?
Then don't have sex because you are not ready."
,"Woah! Not cool. You guys are way too young for sex. I dunno what the law is like where you live, but most places it is downright illegal to have sex at that age. Just wait."
,At 12 years old you should not be thinking of having sex with anybody I have to think the 14 year old boyfriend is pressuring you to do this.  It is against the law and you could both end up in trouble.  It's against the law for a reason and that's because you're still a child and not ready to make these decisions yet.  Please listen to the advice you've got here because you're going to get really messed up if you give in to this.
,"I mean, if you wnat to then you want to but you should probably be alone together and in a goooood spot. Closets work well (kay, maybe not, but you gotta admit nobody will see you)"
,"If you are scared then you are not ready.
At least one of the two of you have the sense to have condoms and know how to safely use them...I hope."
,Well...of course you are scared and you should be. Your bf should even be more afraid. Him getting caught having sex with you can get him arrested and ending up on a sexual predator list. You are entirely too young to be making such a decision. Not to mention the risks.  There are STDs. If you should get one then you hace to tell someone so you can get treated. You are not even a teenager yet. You cannot get medical attention without a parent or guardian. You need to wait.

My boyfriend want to have sex but i am 14?,"ANONYMOUS.........""IS IT BETTER TO GIVE IN?  YOU MIGHT ASK.  ""AFTER ALL, ISN'T EVERYONE HAVING SEX?
STOP AND THINK!!!!
DISTRESS -  MOST YOUTHS WHO HAVE ENGAGED IN PREMARITAL SEX SAY THAT THEY REGRETTED IT AFTERWARD.
""HOW ABOUT DISTRUST"" -  AFTER HAVING SEX, EACH PARTNER BEGINS TO WONDER, WHO ELSE HAS HE/SHE HAD SEX WITH?
DISILLUSIONMENT - DEEP DOWN, MANY GIRLS WOULD PREFER SOMEONE WHO WILL PROTECT THEM, NOT USE THEM.  AND MANY BOYS FIND THAT THEY ARE LESS ATTRACTED TO A GIRL WHO HAS GIVEN IN TO THEIR ADVANCES.
YOU HAVE A CHOICE AS TO HOW YOUR BODY SHOULD BE TREATED.  NEVER ALLOW ANYONE TO BULLY YOU INTO  DOING SOMETHING YOU DON'T WANT TO DO.  AS A YOUNG PERSON DO YOU KNOW THE PROBLEMS THAT COULD ARISE FROM HAVING SEX?  SUCH AS  "" UNWANTED PREGNANCIES, AND SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES"".  ""SEX IS TOO SPECIAL A GIFT TO WASTE"". 
HE BOTTOM LINE - YOUR BODY IS FAR TOO VALUABLE TO GIVE AWAY.  SHOW THAT YOU HAVE STRENGTH OF CHARACTER BY OBEYING GOD'S LAWS AGAINST HAVING PREMARITAL SEX.  YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOU BELIEVE BEFORE YOU FACE PRESSURE OR TEMPTATION TO HAVE SEX.
REMEMBER:  YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE PROUD THAT YOU ARE A VIRGIN AND IT'S YOUR CHOICE TO REMAIN MORALLY CLEAN UNTIL YOU CAN MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY HANDLE THE PRESSURE AND RESPONSIBILITY THAT COMES WITH HAVING PREMARITAL SEX."
,"Chances are you are not legally able to concent to sex at the very young age of 14. By law most states see you as not old enough to concent. By you NOT giving in, you are saving your ""boyfriend"" a possibility of being labelled a sex offender. Besides if you are not ready then he has NO say so! NO MEANS NO!"
,"You made a statement, not asked a question. You just put a question mark at the end. I am not sayinying this to be judgemental, but to point out the underlying feeling that is coming across. Your boyfriend wants to have sex. You don't say you want to. You tell your age. That is coming across as you are nit ready. That you feel you are not mature enough for such a commitment. And it is a commitment. Having sex can change your life in many ways.
You could get pregnant, even if you use protection. You could get a disease. Some don't show symptoms in girls for months or even years. It is a decision that shouldn't be made lightly.
I would say from your ""question"" you don't want to. So don't. If your boyfriend doesn't undetstand or respect that, lose him. I know you care about him, but if he can't respect your decision to wait, he jyst plain doesn't respect you. That is not love."

is it normal for a 12 year old to have hidden depression?,"I'm so sorry, a lot of young people suffer from teen depression. Some causes may be physical or mental. But the bible tells us at Isaiah 33:24: ""No resident will say, I am sick"". There's a website that I often refer to to help with this question along with others you may need answers to, jw.org. "
,"ANONYMOUS.........THE SYMPTOMS OF TEEN DEPRESSION CAN APPEAR DURING ADOLESCENCE.
WHAT PARENTS CAN DO; 
Recognize that depressed teens may find it hard to express their feelings or may not understand what is happening to them. They may not even be aware of the symptoms of depression.
Teens tend to express their depression in ways different from those of adults, so be alert to major changes in your child’s behavior, eating habits, moods, sleep patterns, or social interactions—especially if the changes persist for weeks.
Take seriously any comments or hints regarding suicide.
If you suspect depression (not just the blues), consider getting a professional diagnosis.
Help your teen adhere to the doctor’s prescribed treatment, and consult the doctor if you see no improvement or observe unpleasant side effects.
Have a stable family routine for eating, exercising, and sleeping.
Maintain good communication with your teen, and help him or her to deal with any stigma associated with depression.
Because depression can make one feel alone, ashamed, or worthless, regularly reassure your teen of your love."
,Depression anybody can suffer from it. There are always telltale signs and would be prudent the person in question not to be left alone.

Why is lifting weights better than cardio?,"For my body, cardio is. Weight lifting would bulk me up making me look even fatter!"
,Neither one is good for me!  Makes you sweat.
,"It isn't.
They both contribute to calorie loss and fat burning. Cardio and diet contribute to burning Visceral fat, whereas Lifting weights to create Lean Dense muscle contribute to burning more Subcutaneous fat.
More correctly, they both contribute to overall fat loss, but Cardio usually hits both. It is actually important to combine the two forms of exercise for a well balanced health.
Cardio also burns in the here and now whereas Weight lifting caloric burn, usually lasts for 24 to 48 hours depending upon the exercise. ""Dead Lifts"" and ""Squats"" are just two examples of weight training exercises that can burn calories up to 48 hours."
,Lifting weights one thing and maintaining it is another. In the long run stick to simple exercises.

Help on decorating a room?,"Paint your bedroom yellow. Kitchen red, with stainless or black appliances and dark cabinets. Bathroom paint Mauve with a solid or matching flower shower curtain.
All items can be purchased from either Wal-Mart, Target and JCPenney."
,"If you're talking about a bedroom, I think it's best to invest on pillows and rugs and blankets. Regarding color, it you want your room to look wider, paint it a light color i.e. Sky blur, baby pink, pale yellow, off white."
,"Bees. Shove your room full of bees.
But actually how to decorate your room would depend on what kind of room it is. Kitchen? Living room? Bedroom? Generally I think posters or paintings are very nice; I have a lot in my room. I'm able to get some pretty neat art at the renaissance festival, so I'd recommend getting items there to decorate your room with if there's one near where you live. Festivals in general is a good place to get art. Posters might seem juivinaile, however."
,"Decorate a room with confidence the following ideas -
Choose light furniture with simple lines.
Natural colours mixed with lighter shades of blue and green
work well in a living area.
Use mirrors effectively.
Match the furniture to the scale of the room.
Choose multifunctional furniture.
Lighting is important in any room, use layer lighting."

What can I do to make my hair less greasy?,Try changing brands of shampoo and conditioner. Certain ones just don't work for my hair. Also (for me) it can depend on the time of year. Like right now (the start of winter) my hair is so dry. Even though it's the same shampoo and conditioner I use for summer.
,"I have a seemingly counterintuitive suggestion: Of course if you’re not shampooing regularly already, you should shampoo more often.
However, if you ARE shampooing regularly, and it’s not working, I would suggest trying to CUT DOWN on shampooing. Shampooing strips hair of natural oils, and your scalp may produce more and more as a result.
Search up “no -poo”, there communities of people doing this and it works for them. Might not work for everyone.
Also, use dry shampoo!!! Basically it’s alcohol and powder in a aerosol can. Spray it in your hair, wait 3 minutes, then comb it all out. It rids all the oil and germs. There’s even dark dry shampoo for dark hair! (Lol I discovered it just this month and it’s really improved my hair situation.) If it works good on my long hair, I can imagine it’ll work even better for shorter hair.
If your hair gets too dry, take a tiny bit of coconut oil and comb that over the ends of your hair (not the scalp). Wash every other day, or if you sweat/get dirty. Otherwise, shower but put on a shower cap (or a walmart bag like i do...it’s very loud though)."
,Don't put grease?
,Shampoo often.  Use a shampoo designed to improve oily hair .... Almost every brand has a selection like that.
"My Brother Cheated On His Girlfriend, Should I Tell Her?","No, you should not tell her.  It is there business.  I know its tough and you want to but it is not your business to tell her.  Guys and girls both cheat sometimes it is sad and awful but that is life.  She will probably eventually find out some other way.  Your brother is your family and you don't want to start problems.  Maybe if you still feel like telling her have her find out some other way that don't involve you or your friends or family and that it don't come back on.  Good luck and take care."
,"That's a difficult question...it depends n what you are willing to deal with personally. What your brother is doing is terrible, but horribly commonplace. Should she know? Absolutely. The question is, are you willing to damage your relationship with your brother? Depending on how old he is, he will likely get over the 'betrayal' of you telling his girlfriend the truth, but in the meantime, his motto would be to keep out! Did you personally witness cheating, did he tell you, or did you suspect it? If you personally witnessed it and you feel she might be in some danger (STD's, etc.), perhaps try to remind your brother of the very selfish danger he's putting her in. I know it's hard, but remind him how angry and hurt he would feel if she betrayed him. It is up to you whether or not to confront him or her, but you have many options. Could you tell a parent and have them talk to him (without him knowing it was you)? It's true, it's their business, but the people being hurt rarely like to be the laughing stock as everyone stands around them and wonders..."
,Listen to lisamarie1; that's one of the best answers I've seen on blurtit.
,"Come on if you say he's your brother and you care about him; you should
tell him whats wrong in his relationship. But if you keep it to
yourself, you're not being loyal to him."
,"No, you shouldn't tell her that.  You need to remain loyal to your brother in this regard, no matter how hard that may be and no matter how much he does stupid things.  Hopefully, he will eventually come around and realize he needs to get his act together. "
,"Guys, listen...... !!!carefully.if you will never commit in a relationship, please never be in it.... Being liberal is a disease that does not have cure! I meant cancer you hear???. Anytime you cheat on somebody that dsz.... Will never go. Why? You have planted a seed and all it needs is your thought"
,Don't get involved that will just create drama! Your brother will just get mad at you and that will start a whoe other problem. YOUR not the one who is at fault so YOU shouldn't have to clean up after your brother. However you should try to convince your brother to tell his girlfriend the truth. Hope this helps. Good Luck!
,"I have always been very skeptical about intruding on others privacy, loved ones or colleagues.

How Can You Tell If A Girl Is Cheating On You?,"When you first start thinking a girl is cheating on you then there is obviously something wrong with your relationship and you will notice little things, like she does not answer your calls all the time. She will say she was in the bath/shower, or left it in other room, or the phone will be turned off and she will say the battery was flat.

Has she got a load of new friends that you have never heard of before or just one friend who she has not mentioned to you? When you query her she will say that she has told you about her, so then it starts putting doubts in your head and then you start to imagine it is you with the problem.

She starts to argue with you for no reason, and then storms out, accusing you of always starting arguments. Has she taken a bit more care of herself when going out, for example: Spending more time doing her hair, wearing best clothes when she is out with the girls, showing a bit more cleavage or a bit more leg?

Never let a girl who you are in a relationship with go to a nightclub without you, there is a reason she does not want you there. Lads are bad when they are out, but believe me girls are twenty times worse.

It is very easy for girls to get noticed and even if they are not the prettiest there is always some lad in any town who will want to brag about going with that girl in the club last night. Check her mobile call history for numbers that have no names. Maybe even ring the number, and you never know it might be answered by someone saying hello sweetheart/gorgeous etc.

Only someone who is very close to your girlfriend would do this and it would certainly have their name next to the number. If she insists on going out with her girlfriends tell her you will meet her somewhere later on. See if she then has a change of plan, or texts(likely) or phones(unlikely) to say they have all gone somewhere else as it was quiet.

When you see her next time she will say she had no signal to let you know they had a late change of plans. Do not tell your mates you think she is cheating as it could be them who she is cheating with. It is very easy to catch a cheat, but you will know if she is cheating because your instincts and your heart will tell you."
,"Easy, you will tell. Her eyes will be burning a different stare. If she doesn't act differently at all, but you still have the inkling (or if she has a history), then she is probably a much more experienced cheater.

Cocky, dramatic and beautiful girls are much more likely to cheat, most likely with your friends if they are reasonably close. If you think she is cheating, she probably is and if she isn't and you think she is, then you probably shouldn't be with her anyway.

Tell her you want to spend some time away from her for a week or two (detach yourself from her because you're probably being paranoid needy and pushing her away), then don't talk for a couple of days. 

Remember women cheat mostly for emotional reasons and they will rationalise it and say that was out of their control, thus shedding responsibility. If she seems cold she is probably blaming you for her guilt (as she is controlled by her emotions).

Everyone is capable of cheating (Its hard-wired into us), the best thing you can do is to keep one step back from a girl at all times and only reward good behaviour with attention. If you feel she is cheating, then don't do all those good things you have been doing for her. Her rationale if she were cheating on you would be: ""If you make me feel as though I am cheating, then it's almost as bad as if I was"".

Remember there are some amazing girls out there who are much more mature and stable, however you will find a lot of gorgeous girls have a lot of personal problems because they have never had to grow up or be responsible for their actions.

If you have one of these girls, don't try to see the inner beauty - have fun physically, instead. They will cause you enormous heartache. Find yourself a different girl, in fact find yourself a number of girlfriends (don't just stick to one girlfriend because it guarantees you sex that is disrespectful to her and to yourself).

Anyway don't worry to much about it, If she is cheating, don't give her the joy of the chase, ignore her burn all that lovey stuff you had together (they were only props in her fantasy anyway, while she had the romance with you, she took the penis from others like a true champ). Find somebody new and don't make the same mistake. Peace out."
,"There's always ways to find out. Try to get close to her best friend, one of her best friends might rat on her friend because they see what a great guy you are.

Also if she always calls you or texts you every morning saying something sweet, and all of a sudden she stops texting you, then something is up.

Facebook is always a good way to catch a cheater, try making a fake page and make friends with her. Start talking to her, little by little, start liking her statuses, and make her talk to you. That's how I found one of my ex girlfriends - she flirted with me on my fake page, and I never told her. I kept it this way for a while.

She gave me her number saying she was single and that she likes to drink and party that we should meet up one day, but I always said I couldn't. I used a text free number to text her I would text her from my iPod when I was in the restroom, saying ""hi how are you sweetheart?"" or ""are you busy, can we talk?"". When I walked back in the room, I would ask her who just texted her, and she would say it was her best friend.

There was one time when she told me she was having problems with a man and needed me to go pick her up that got me mad, but didn't show it. She got in the shower, and I got one of my friends to call her back and ask her if she wanted to meet up. She agreed.

When she got out of the shower I asked her if she was going to meet a friend and she said ""yeah, I'll be back soon"" so I told her I'd come with her, and then she started saying ""no, she needs me, she don't want you to see her like this, blah blah blah...""

Well guess what? I was the guy she was meeting up with! My friend picked me up and we went to meet her. I texted her, and told her I was in the black car. When she started walking to the car I rolled the window down, and the look on her face was priceless!

If you want her to admit her mistake, and tell you the truth, then you should show her how much you love her. Show her what she means to you, and what her existence means to you. Tell her that her love has shown you the new part of life.

After knowing all this she will feel bad and guilty for cheating on you, and being disloyal. But then again what you're considering might only your imagination or assumptions.

,"She will often avoid your eyes, and whenever you try to make plans, she will awkwardly struggle for an excuse. If she is known to be a good liar, well, just pull her to the side and ask her if anything is wrong. Just be honest."
,"Okay, its easy I have an example: When you're done making love to your girlfriend, and you're still in  bed, hugging and kissing, say ""I know"", or ""I know what happened"", or ""I know what you did"" - something like that.

For me, it was only ""I know"" - and remember, do not mention anything about cheating. Once you've said that, if she answers with: ""I didnt cheat on you"", it's 100% certain that she did, because you didnt even mention anything about cheating. Once she says that, you say: ""I didnt even say anything like that"". If she gets mad in any way, then she cheated - simple is that."

,"One of the first things is that you will feel it in your heart. It is a nagging sensation that finally makes you start to notice things. Maybe, as a couple you were initially very relaxed together, and suddenly you don't feel so laid back around her.

Believe me, you will know if she is cheating on you: Remember the eyes are the mirror to your soul, even the best liar can't stop the eyes from showing the truth."
,The most obvious thing that you can spot is that she is really nervous around you!
,"Women that lie will cheat, I can't stand that. If my girl ever cheats on me, I'll just toss her out and check in with the next girl on my list. If they cheat, oh well - they'll never see me again, either."
,She becomes distant and quickly gets attitude. She doesn't let you see her phone and will find any excuse to get mad. I'm just saying from experience. I'm sorry MJ.
,"Well I have done it before, it's quite simple actually. She will carry her phone about with her day and night, she wont leave it lying around where you can get it.

If you are sitting watching TV, she will  keep asking whether you are all right? Then she get all nervous, and lost for words, but trust me, in the end she will always feel guilty."
,You can tell if she hasn't been spending much time with you and doesn't want to answer your calls.
,"Well I believe my girl is doing just that. She will erase texts and calls from her phone. She said she did it because she was bored. A lot of times she does not answer my calls, and comes up with dumb excuses. 

We have been together three years and only three times have I 'hit the back'.  Now out of nowhere she likes it there.  I think she has been with someone else, and just feels bad because she let someone else hit that, and that whenever I asked her, she would just call me names.  Now that's all she wants.

She would cook lunch for me everyday.  We work at same company as drivers, we would meet there for lunch. Now she is always running late. Too bad its her conscience. She will carry that for life."
,"She sounds like a complete head-case dude! If your relationship faces a problem, but at the first chance she runs into another guys' arms, then it can't be very good.

Sit her down and tell her your fears, and ask her if she really thinks your relationship is worth carrying on. I know how much it hurts, but if she isn't 100% into you, she doesn't deserve the relationship and it's better for you in the long run to break up with her."
,"If she seems like she is hanging out with other guys, then she might be cheating on you. Ask her if she wants to go out. If she stumbles or says no, or even just sounds unsure, take that as a sign. Ask her if she still wants to be with you."
,"If she avoids you, and starts to flirt with guys."
,"Well, there are a few things. For one, don't forget the song lyrics ""Believe half of what you see and none of what you hear"". That's a good thing to remember. There will be little things a cheater will do, like lying. You don't want a liar. You definitely don't want a cheater.

If you feel there is reason to wonder, then you need to talk to your lady and find out if you are right or not. If you can't get anywhere that way, you can ask other people who know her. I do not suggest you set her up to test her, although sometimes that is the only way.

In today's world it is very important to be safe, and random flings with cheating people can have you at the clinic getting a prescription for something, or worse. Not to mention the morals you would want to be present in the mother of any children you have. Be picky - do not settle."
,"Oh that's a tough one, with me being a girl it's hard for me to answer this question, but if you have doubts just confront her and say something like: ""I want to be the only guy for you, I can't share you, I want to know, is there someone else?"".

If there is, then tough luck kid, sorry. If that doesn't work, talk to her friends and tell them how you feel. (If you do break up with her because she's shady tell her as much, but don't be to mean about it, no one likes to be talked at!).

,Become real cool friends with her friends. Don't go to far with it. Some of her friends who know if she's not doing right will feel bad for you if she is. You might find the truth. Sometimes even more comes from it. I did it once. What goes around comes around.
,"So, recently my girlfriend started talking to a guy on Facebook. One night whilst watching a movie with her she goes onto my laptop to check her Facebook and sits there for ages using the 'chat' feature on it.

I noticed that she's talking to the guy in question so I asked her who she's talking to - the answer was that it was a mutual friend of ours. So I left it. I checked again, and as soon as I turned my head she closes the page. So I pretended to stretch and watch TV and then noticed she reopened the chat with the guy.

I confronted her about it and asked why she lied. She got nervous and said she wasn't lying to me (she wasn't technically lying, but she did withhold the information when I asked). Eventually she told me he was being inappropriate to her, that she didn't want me getting jealous or annoyed about it, and that she was telling him to get lost.

A couple of nights later, my iPod starts bleeping, so I check it and find she had been using the Facebook app on it, and was still logged in. From what I read I saw that she had traded numbers with a guy and was texting and ringing him and talking on MSN.

Now from past experience I go by gut feeling, I'm not a jealous guy because my girlfriend has many male friends that I'm fine with. But for my girlfriend to suddenly start talking to someone and get his number a couple of days later when shes never even met the guy before is a little odd to me.

I confronted her about it and told her how I'd found out. She told me nothing was going on, she also said 'me and him get on well'. She added that she felt lonely (most of her close friends have moved away recently and she doesnt get to talk to them much). So I understood that, but she had still kept talking to the guy even after telling me he was being inappropriate to her.

Recently I've noticed her being online quite late at night, when in the past she hasnt been (she's logged in on MSN, and has also been on after telling me over the phone that she was going to bed a couple of hours previously).

So far all this, plus my gut feeling is telling me she's hiding something. I also checked her phone a few minutes ago and she has deleted all her messages, inbox and sent messages.

She hasn't changed her attitude towards me much. But I know her and she's a smart girl, she could hide behind a false mask if she felt the need to.

Any help on this would be appreciated, am I being paranoid? Should I wait and see if anything else turns up?"
,"To be honest with everyone on here, I trust my girlfriend completely. When we first started dating it was perfect. Cute lovely phrases, lots of touching and she called and wrote to me constantly.

Here we are two years down the road and she rarely answers my calls, saying she left her phone in the other room, or her battery died. She's not straight-forward with me any more.  I came home to find her in bed with my brother last week.

Of course I was expecting it, her tell tale signs are: Stuttering when asked a question about other guys; lack of closeness; distant; and she stopped being straight-forward with me.

Basic knowledge about your girl will help you spot any problems. Pay attention to her emotional attachment, her intimacy towards you, and her personality at the beginning of your relationship. Personality changes when someone has something to hide.

I'm an eye person, I look into eyes and examine them. If your girl often looked into your eyes  when you first started dating, and now looks away, you know something is wrong. Doesn't necessarily mean she's cheating.

How they react is the best way. The things you did in the beginning that drove her crazy, end up not working on her any more, it usually means something else was done to her that she liked better. Best of luck to all of you, hope it helps - hope you don't end up like me.

,"If she stops calling you for a long period of time, and how she is in school (if she acts weird, or not the same as before), I am sorry but she might be cheating.

If you are in different schools, you can always pop out of no-where or decide to meet her after school and see for yourself. Sorry if my answer is no help to you."
,By her jealous face and lips because she probably kissed that other guy.
,"Some of the signs to help you tell is if she has been acting detached lately, doesn't say that cute stuff to you any more, and if she has been trying to avoid you."
,"Well this might sound quite sneaky, but check her cell phone - they usually have conversations with the guy if they are cheating."
,"I would not rely on the so-called 'tell-tale' signs, because the only way to really know is to catch them in the act. However, even just a suspicion of cheating means that there isn't full trust in the relationship (or that there are other unresolved issues), and this is probably a bigger problem (since it is the cause of these issues), than if she was really cheating on you."
,"You can tell if a girl is cheating on you because she will become very distant. She will ignore your phone calls and say she is spending time with her pals, who you have never heard off. One thing I have learnt is to just get over the fact she is cheating, but if you love her, give it another go,

Make sure the other bloke knows his place! But, if you can't get over it then split up with her or else you will go crazy. But most of you blokes will just think there is something going on as she is a lot better looking than you are or she has had a lot of other blokes in the past.

But never doubt your partner without reason as you will drive her away. I have a saying which goes: "" Don't accuse unless you have proof"".

I hope this helps."
,"If she is acting weird, and it seems like she's talking to, or seeing someone else."
,"If you know the person, you can easily understand if she is cheating. The thing is how to prove it and make her confess."

,What would you do if she is? Still hang around?
,"She tends to do dumb things like saying she's going to bed, but when you drive by her house the car's gone - who does that?"

,If she does not answer her phone.
,Ask her.
,The only way you will know if your girlfriend is cheating on you is to ask her!
,"Sigh... I'm a girl and I'm online right now looking for solutions to something last night that I shouldn't have done. The whole cheating thing where she doesn't answer your calls and blah blah doesn't always apply.

For me, I did something terrible last night that went against my own rules while I was drunk and here I am going crazy over it. I want to see my boyfriend and I am scared to tell him. I don't know if I should.

We're in a long-distance three-year relationship, and he's the best thing that's ever happened to me. Why did I cheat on him last night? Because there was a physical attraction between me and a guy here at college that has been producing sexual tension ever since I met him.

It was great when it happened but I would not ever give up what I have with my boyfriend for it. It was stupid of me and I hate myself right now. I let myself down, and my boyfriend and I desperately want to see him again.

What our interaction will be at that point, I'm not sure. We trust each other 100%. I know he would never cheat on me and he knows I would never cheat on him. I knew I never would cheat on him. And here I am hating myself.

The point is, if someone cheats, guy or girl, it depends on your relationship with them. If you are suspicious and want to know how you can tell if she's cheating, then already there is something wrong. But if she's acting funny and you know she would never do this to you - it's a possibility that it's eating her alive inside. So, look at your relationship with her and see whether it's worth it or not."

What can I do to make my hair less greasy?,Try changing brands of shampoo and conditioner. Certain ones just don't work for my hair. Also (for me) it can depend on the time of year. Like right now (the start of winter) my hair is so dry. Even though it's the same shampoo and conditioner I use for summer.
,"I have a seemingly counterintuitive suggestion: Of course if you’re not shampooing regularly already, you should shampoo more often.
However, if you ARE shampooing regularly, and it’s not working, I would suggest trying to CUT DOWN on shampooing. Shampooing strips hair of natural oils, and your scalp may produce more and more as a result.
Search up “no -poo”, there communities of people doing this and it works for them. Might not work for everyone.
Also, use dry shampoo!!! Basically it’s alcohol and powder in a aerosol can. Spray it in your hair, wait 3 minutes, then comb it all out. It rids all the oil and germs. There’s even dark dry shampoo for dark hair! (Lol I discovered it just this month and it’s really improved my hair situation.) If it works good on my long hair, I can imagine it’ll work even better for shorter hair.
If your hair gets too dry, take a tiny bit of coconut oil and comb that over the ends of your hair (not the scalp). Wash every other day, or if you sweat/get dirty. Otherwise, shower but put on a shower cap (or a walmart bag like i do...it’s very loud though)."
,Don't put grease?
,Shampoo often.  Use a shampoo designed to improve oily hair .... Almost every brand has a selection like that.
Its national whiners day. National thanku note day . national candy cane day. And boxing day. Do u know any whiners??????????????????????,"Yes, I work with a couple whiners."

All my candy canes are gone.:(
Don't care about boxing.
I have a couple of thank you notes to write, so that's what I will do."
,"I think whiners should be recorded and have to hear what they sound like. Bet they stop! Or at least cut back.
No candy canes. I HAVE to lose weight! No if and's or but's.
I don't like boxing.
So it looks like I will write a thank you note! ?"

How Can You Tell If A Girl Is Cheating On You?,"When you first start thinking a girl is cheating on you then there is obviously something wrong with your relationship and you will notice little things, like she does not answer your calls all the time. She will say she was in the bath/shower, or left it in other room, or the phone will be turned off and she will say the battery was flat.

Has she got a load of new friends that you have never heard of before or just one friend who she has not mentioned to you? When you query her she will say that she has told you about her, so then it starts putting doubts in your head and then you start to imagine it is you with the problem.

She starts to argue with you for no reason, and then storms out, accusing you of always starting arguments. Has she taken a bit more care of herself when going out, for example: Spending more time doing her hair, wearing best clothes when she is out with the girls, showing a bit more cleavage or a bit more leg?

Never let a girl who you are in a relationship with go to a nightclub without you, there is a reason she does not want you there. Lads are bad when they are out, but believe me girls are twenty times worse.

It is very easy for girls to get noticed and even if they are not the prettiest there is always some lad in any town who will want to brag about going with that girl in the club last night. Check her mobile call history for numbers that have no names. Maybe even ring the number, and you never know it might be answered by someone saying hello sweetheart/gorgeous etc.

Only someone who is very close to your girlfriend would do this and it would certainly have their name next to the number. If she insists on going out with her girlfriends tell her you will meet her somewhere later on. See if she then has a change of plan, or texts(likely) or phones(unlikely) to say they have all gone somewhere else as it was quiet.

When you see her next time she will say she had no signal to let you know they had a late change of plans. Do not tell your mates you think she is cheating as it could be them who she is cheating with. It is very easy to catch a cheat, but you will know if she is cheating because your instincts and your heart will tell you."
,"Easy, you will tell. Her eyes will be burning a different stare. If she doesn't act differently at all, but you still have the inkling (or if she has a history), then she is probably a much more experienced cheater.

Cocky, dramatic and beautiful girls are much more likely to cheat, most likely with your friends if they are reasonably close. If you think she is cheating, she probably is and if she isn't and you think she is, then you probably shouldn't be with her anyway.

Tell her you want to spend some time away from her for a week or two (detach yourself from her because you're probably being paranoid needy and pushing her away), then don't talk for a couple of days. 

Remember women cheat mostly for emotional reasons and they will rationalise it and say that was out of their control, thus shedding responsibility. If she seems cold she is probably blaming you for her guilt (as she is controlled by her emotions).

Everyone is capable of cheating (Its hard-wired into us), the best thing you can do is to keep one step back from a girl at all times and only reward good behaviour with attention. If you feel she is cheating, then don't do all those good things you have been doing for her. Her rationale if she were cheating on you would be: ""If you make me feel as though I am cheating, then it's almost as bad as if I was"".

Remember there are some amazing girls out there who are much more mature and stable, however you will find a lot of gorgeous girls have a lot of personal problems because they have never had to grow up or be responsible for their actions.

Find yourself a different girl, in fact find yourself a number of girlfriends (don't just stick to one girlfriend because it guarantees you sex that is disrespectful to her and to yourself).

Anyway don't worry to much about it, If she is cheating, don't give her the joy of the chase, ignore her burn all that lovey stuff you had together (they were only props in her fantasy anyway, while she had the romance with you, she took the penis from others like a true champ). Find somebody new and don't make the same mistake. Peace out."

,"Well I have done it before, it's quite simple actually. She will carry her phone about with her day and night, she wont leave it lying around where you can get it.

If you are sitting watching TV, she will  keep asking whether you are all right? Then she get all nervous, and lost for words, but trust me, in the end she will always feel guilty."
,You can tell if she hasn't been spending much time with you and doesn't want to answer your calls.
,"Well I believe my girl is doing just that. She will erase texts and calls from her phone. She said she did it because she was bored. A lot of times she does not answer my calls, and comes up with dumb excuses. 

We have been together three years and only three times have I 'hit the back'.  Now out of nowhere she likes it there.  I think she has been with someone else, and just feels bad because she let someone else hit that, and that whenever I asked her, she would just call me names.  Now that's all she wants.

She would cook lunch for me everyday.  We work at same company as drivers, we would meet there for lunch. Now she is always running late. Too bad its her conscience. She will carry that for life."
,"She sounds like a complete head-case dude! If your relationship faces a problem, but at the first chance she runs into another guys' arms, then it can't be very good.

Sit her down and tell her your fears, and ask her if she really thinks your relationship is worth carrying on. I know how much it hurts, but if she isn't 100% into you, she doesn't deserve the relationship and it's better for you in the long run to break up with her."
,"If she seems like she is hanging out with other guys, then she might be cheating on you. Ask her if she wants to go out. If she stumbles or says no, or even just sounds unsure, take that as a sign. Ask her if she still wants to be with you."
,"If she avoids you, and starts to flirt with guys."
,"Well, there are a few things. For one, don't forget the song lyrics ""Believe half of what you see and none of what you hear"". That's a good thing to remember. There will be little things a cheater will do, like lying. You don't want a liar. You definitely don't want a cheater.

If you feel there is reason to wonder, then you need to talk to your lady and find out if you are right or not. If you can't get anywhere that way, you can ask other people who know her. I do not suggest you set her up to test her, although sometimes that is the only way.

In today's world it is very important to be safe, and random flings with cheating people can have you at the clinic getting a prescription for something, or worse. Not to mention the morals you would want to be present in the mother of any children you have. Be picky - do not settle."
,"Oh that's a tough one, with me being a girl it's hard for me to answer this question, but if you have doubts just confront her and say something like: ""I want to be the only guy for you, I can't share you, I want to know, is there someone else?"".

If there is, then tough luck kid, sorry. If that doesn't work, talk to her friends and tell them how you feel. (If you do break up with her because she's shady tell her as much, but don't be to mean about it, no one likes to be talked at!).

- Erica"
,Become real cool friends with her friends. Don't go to far with it. Some of her friends who know if she's not doing right will feel bad for you if she is. You might find the truth. Sometimes even more comes from it. I did it once. What goes around comes around.
,"So, recently my girlfriend started talking to a guy on Facebook. One night whilst watching a movie with her she goes onto my laptop to check her Facebook and sits there for ages using the 'chat' feature on it.

I noticed that she's talking to the guy in question so I asked her who she's talking to - the answer was that it was a mutual friend of ours. So I left it. I checked again, and as soon as I turned my head she closes the page. So I pretended to stretch and watch TV and then noticed she reopened the chat with the guy.

I confronted her about it and asked why she lied. She got nervous and said she wasn't lying to me (she wasn't technically lying, but she did withhold the information when I asked). Eventually she told me he was being inappropriate to her, that she didn't want me getting jealous or annoyed about it, and that she was telling him to get lost.

A couple of nights later, my iPod starts bleeping, so I check it and find she had been using the Facebook app on it, and was still logged in. From what I read I saw that she had traded numbers with a guy and was texting and ringing him and talking on MSN.

Now from past experience I go by gut feeling, I'm not a jealous guy because my girlfriend has many male friends that I'm fine with. But for my girlfriend to suddenly start talking to someone and get his number a couple of days later when shes never even met the guy before is a little odd to me.

I confronted her about it and told her how I'd found out. She told me nothing was going on, she also said 'me and him get on well'. She added that she felt lonely (most of her close friends have moved away recently and she doesnt get to talk to them much). So I understood that, but she had still kept talking to the guy even after telling me he was being inappropriate to her.

Recently I've noticed her being online quite late at night, when in the past she hasnt been (she's logged in on MSN, and has also been on after telling me over the phone that she was going to bed a couple of hours previously).

So far all this, plus my gut feeling is telling me she's hiding something. I also checked her phone a few minutes ago and she has deleted all her messages, inbox and sent messages.

She hasn't changed her attitude towards me much. But I know her and she's a smart girl, she could hide behind a false mask if she felt the need to.

Any help on this would be appreciated, am I being paranoid? Should I wait and see if anything else turns up?"
,"To be honest with everyone on here, I trust my girlfriend completely. When we first started dating it was perfect. Cute lovely phrases, lots of touching and she called and wrote to me constantly.

Here we are two years down the road and she rarely answers my calls, saying she left her phone in the other room, or her battery died. She's not straight-forward with me any more.  I came home to find her in bed with my brother last week.

Of course I was expecting it, her tell tale signs are: Stuttering when asked a question about other guys; lack of closeness; distant; and she stopped being straight-forward with me.

Basic knowledge about your girl will help you spot any problems. Pay attention to her emotional attachment, her intimacy towards you, and her personality at the beginning of your relationship. Personality changes when someone has something to hide.

I'm an eye person, I look into eyes and examine them. If your girl often looked into your eyes  when you first started dating, and now looks away, you know something is wrong. Doesn't necessarily mean she's cheating.

How they react is the best way. The things you did in the beginning that drove her crazy, end up not working on her any more, it usually means something else was done to her that she liked better. Best of luck to all of you, hope it helps - hope you don't end up like me.

  ~puddin~"
,"If she stops calling you for a long period of time, and how she is in school (if she acts weird, or not the same as before), I am sorry but she might be cheating.

If you are in different schools, you can always pop out of no-where or decide to meet her after school and see for yourself. Sorry if my answer is no help to you."
,By her jealous face and lips because she probably kissed that other guy.
,"Some of the signs to help you tell is if she has been acting detached lately, doesn't say that cute stuff to you any more, and if she has been trying to avoid you."
,"Well this might sound quite sneaky, but check her cell phone - they usually have conversations with the guy if they are cheating."
,"I would not rely on the so-called 'tell-tale' signs, because the only way to really know is to catch them in the act. However, even just a suspicion of cheating means that there isn't full trust in the relationship (or that there are other unresolved issues), and this is probably a bigger problem (since it is the cause of these issues), than if she was really cheating on you."
,"You can tell if a girl is cheating on you because she will become very distant. She will ignore your phone calls and say she is spending time with her pals, who you have never heard off. One thing I have learnt is to just get over the fact she is cheating, but if you love her, give it another go,

Make sure the other bloke knows his place! But, if you can't get over it then split up with her or else you will go crazy. But most of you blokes will just think there is something going on as she is a lot better looking than you are or she has had a lot of other blokes in the past.

But never doubt your partner without reason as you will drive her away. I have a saying which goes: "" Don't accuse unless you have proof"".

I hope this helps."
,"If she is acting weird, and it seems like she's talking to, or seeing someone else."
,"If you know the person, you can easily understand if she is cheating. The thing is how to prove it and make her confess."
,"I have always been very skeptical about intruding on others privacy, loved ones or colleagues. However we all know curiosity can get the best of us at times and only by knowing the truth on some hot-button issues do we truly find peace and closure.I decided to feed my curiosity and give it a shot.

,What would you do if she is? Still hang around?
,"She tends to do dumb things like saying she's going to bed, but when you drive by her house the car's gone - who does that?"
,You kind of need to be a little more descriptive with this question. Piece the clues together - do you think she is cheating on you?
,If she does not answer her phone.
,Ask her.
,The only way you will know if your girlfriend is cheating on you is to ask her!
,"Sigh... I'm a girl and I'm online right now looking for solutions to something last night that I shouldn't have done. The whole cheating thing where she doesn't answer your calls and blah blah doesn't always apply.

For me, I did something terrible last night that went against my own rules while I was drunk and here I am going crazy over it. I want to see my boyfriend and I am scared to tell him. I don't know if I should.

We're in a long-distance three-year relationship, and he's the best thing that's ever happened to me. Why did I cheat on him last night? Because there was a physical attraction between me and a guy here at college that has been producing sexual tension ever since I met him.

It was great when it happened but I would not ever give up what I have with my boyfriend for it. It was stupid of me and I hate myself right now. I let myself down, and my boyfriend and I desperately want to see him again.

What our interaction will be at that point, I'm not sure. We trust each other 100%. I know he would never cheat on me and he knows I would never cheat on him. I knew I never would cheat on him. And here I am hating myself.

The point is, if someone cheats, guy or girl, it depends on your relationship with them. If you are suspicious and want to know how you can tell if she's cheating, then already there is something wrong. But if she's acting funny and you know she would never do this to you - it's a possibility that it's eating her alive inside. So, look at your relationship with her and see whether it's worth it or not."
,Use the grape vine my brother!
,If you catch her having sex with other dudes.
"My Brother Cheated On His Girlfriend, Should I Tell Her?","No, you should not tell her.  It is there business.  I know its tough and you want to but it is not your business to tell her.  Guys and girls both cheat sometimes it is sad and awful but that is life.  She will probably eventually find out some other way.  Your brother is your family and you don't want to start problems.  Maybe if you still feel like telling her have her find out some other way that don't involve you or your friends or family and that it don't come back on.  Good luck and take care."
,"That's a difficult question...it depends n what you are willing to deal with personally. What your brother is doing is terrible, but horribly commonplace. Should she know? Absolutely. The question is, are you willing to damage your relationship with your brother? Depending on how old he is, he will likely get over the 'betrayal' of you telling his girlfriend the truth, but in the meantime, his motto would be to keep out! Did you personally witness cheating, did he tell you, or did you suspect it? If you personally witnessed it and you feel she might be in some danger (STD's, etc.), perhaps try to remind your brother of the very selfish danger he's putting her in. I know it's hard, but remind him how angry and hurt he would feel if she betrayed him. It is up to you whether or not to confront him or her, but you have many options. Could you tell a parent and have them talk to him (without him knowing it was you)? It's true, it's their business, but the people being hurt rarely like to be the laughing stock as everyone stands around them and wonders..."
,Listen to lisamarie1; that's one of the best answers I've seen on blurtit.
,"Come on if you say he's your brother and you care about him; you should
tell him whats wrong in his relationship. But if you keep it to
yourself, you're not being loyal to him."
,"No, you shouldn't tell her that.  You need to remain loyal to your brother in this regard, no matter how hard that may be and no matter how much he does stupid things.  Hopefully, he will eventually come around and realize he needs to get his act together. "
,"Guys, listen...... !!!carefully.if you will never commit in a relationship, please never be in it.... Being liberal is a disease that does not have cure! I meant cancer you hear???. Anytime you cheat on somebody that dsz.... Will never go. Why? You have planted a seed and all it needs is your thought"
,Don't get involved that will just create drama! Your brother will just get mad at you and that will start a whoe other problem. YOUR not the one who is at fault so YOU shouldn't have to clean up after your brother. However you should try to convince your brother to tell his girlfriend the truth. Hope this helps. Good Luck!

How to grow your own weed?,"Growing your own weed can be a rocky road but if you have the time and the patience for it, then you will need to take into account several aspects:
1 – Choose your seeds well. From relaxing to energizing, from creativity inducing to cancer pain relieving there is no shortage of the types of seeds one can choose
from.  Choose yours accordingly to what you are trying to achieve.
2 – Find somewhere appropriate with enough light. Whether outdoors or indoors your seeds will need, at the very least, 6 hours of continuous light exposure (natural or artificial).
3 – Germinate your seeds before planting them. You can do this by popping them in a cup of warm water and leave them in a dark place from 1 to 3 days (until you see a sprout).
4 – Plant the germinated seed in unfertilized soil by digging a not
very deep hole and covering it up. Keep the soil moist at all times.
5 – Provide fresh moving air in the surrounding area. You can do this
with a simple fan.
6 - Transfer the sprout to fertilized soil (as the stronger seed won't
be harmed by it anymore).
7 – Make sure the temperature around the plant is constantly around
the 67 degrees (Fahrenheit) mark.
8 – Watch it grow from 8 to 16 weeks. Your plant should be ready to be harvested when most of the “hairs” on it turn from white to red.
9- Enjoy!
Of course, it goes without saying that marijuana must be legal to grow in your state/country, otherwise none of the above is advisable!"
,"It should be noted that it's illegal to grown marijuana in many places around the world.  For that reason, the following information is for educational purposes only, and should not be used unless it's legal for you to do so wherever you are.
Here are the basic principles of growing your own weed.
First and foremost you'll need to obtain some seeds.  There are a variety of websites offering these products, but I won't list them here.  A simple Google search will provide you with plenty of options.
You'll need to decide where you'll grow your marijuana.  If indoors, you'll need somewhere like a closet or spare bathroom.
The next step is to choose your light.  This is really important, and there are loads of options, including LED grow lights, fluorescent bulbs, and sodium bulbs.
Now you'll need to decide on what soul you'll use.  Organic compost is usually the best choice here.
It's likely that you'll need some soil nutrients unless you're using a high grade compost.  One of the most common choices is Dyna-Gro.
You should now invest in a product such as Rapid Rooter that allows you to germinate your seeds prior to planting them in your high grade soil.  What you need to do is place your seeds into the Rapid Rooters and keep them moist for a fee days until they being to sprout.
You'll want to grow your plants in a warm environment.  The usual recommendations are 70-85F (20-30C).  Your light should remain on the plants for 24 hours per day if possible.
When your cannabis plants start to grow buds, it's time to check for any male plants (the ones with pollen sacs and not white hairs).  Discard the male plants as they do not grow buds.
Now you need to reduce the amount of light your plants get per day to 12 hours on, 12 ours off. 
Your plants will continue to grow until they're ready to harvest.
So there you have it - a very basic guide to growing your own weed.  Please do remember that it's illegal to do this is many areas of the world, and there are severe consequences for those who break the law in this regard."

I Have A Really Bad Skin (acne). What Can I Do?,"A dermatologist friend recommended:

1. Wash with a salicylic acid wash

2. Apply a glycolic acid cream(Alpha Hydroxy) to the entire face and other problem areas

3. Finally use 10% benzoyl peroxide directly on breakouts.

Do daily.

All available at walgreens for a few bucks."
,I have heard good things about this product. But I'm not a specialist in acne treatment. You should talk to a doctor first before using it. Hope this helps.        Www.proactiv.com/index.php?acnt=GHP00000&s_kwcid=acne%20treatment|2161866378
,"Hi,
I used Top Shirley Medicated Cream and it really worked for me.  After years of spending money on a countless number of products which promised to work, I finally found one which actually did what it said.

I use it twice a day, morning and night.  Shirley Medicated Cream has really cleared my skin up, I no longer break out, and best of all it has faded my acne scars.  I would thoroughly recommend this to any one with serious skin problems.

I brought mine from www.shirleycream.co.uk.  Give it a go.  I hope it helps."
,"While some skin problems are fixable through home remedies and simple hacks, for more serious problems such as acne or pigmentation, you need more than that. Acne is a deep rooted problem that requires a high-performance skincare solution, such as Melblok Home Kit Advanced. Bundling dedicated products for day and night, the kit is the only product you will ever need to keep hyperpigmentation at bay."
,I'm currently using top shirely medicated cream I have a friend who tried it and the effects were unbelievable.. I heard some really good things about it .. Its very cheap and you can find it in beauty stores
How To Reduce The Melanin And Get The Beautiful Whiteness In Face?,"In some cases, you can reduce melanin and increase the whiteness in your face by using special creams with active ingredients known as mercurous chloride and/or hydroquinone. These chemical agents remove pigment from the skin; however, they don't work immediately. A regular course of treatment with such lotions or ointments will be needed, and results may vary based on each person's original skin tone, as well as other variables.

Stars such as the late Michael Jackson were rumored to use such creams to excess - in Jackson's case, if he did use lightening creams to alter the tone of his complexion, he spoiled a lovely, dark skin tone, turning it almost bone-white over time. It can be tempting to use such creams to exact a radical change - however, you can be almost certain that your natural skin tone is really the best choice for you. Dark skin is beautiful and hides flaws more easily than pale, porcelain skin does. There can be many benefits to staying darker. Melanin also protects the skin (to an extent) from sun damage and other health problems related to the skin; the skin is our body's biggest organ, so you must be careful how you treat it. If you choose to use skin lighteners for whiter skin, be certain you do so under a dermatologist's care. At the least, make sure the products you choose (such as hydroquinone creams) are highly rated and produced by trusted manufacturers. Don't take chances with your complexion, as reversing skin lightening can be difficult, and results may not always be even or exactly what you envisioned before you started treatment.

Skin-lightening creams are available from dermatologists, and in drugstores and chain stores. The amounts of active ingredients in each product will vary; products prescribed by a doctor will generally have a higher concentration of active ingredients - products sold over the counter will have lower amounts of active ingredients, so they are safer for everyday use without a doctor's supervision."
,"Excessive exposure to UV rays from the sun is one of the most common causes of melanin or hyperpigmentation. To lessen the damaging impact of UV rays on your skin, always apply an opaque sunblock screen containing zinc oxide or titanium oxide before stepping out in the sun.
You may use Melblok Advanced Day Cream, an anti-pigmentation moisturizing day cream for Pigmentation-prone skin."
,"You cannot reduce the melanin in your face but you can wear sun protecting creams, keep out of the sun as much as possible."
,"Better not to be a 'white ghost', and retain your natural beauty. Being white didn't do much for Wacko Jacko."
,"Use hydroquinone, or kojic acid, stay out of sun, use sunbloack above 30 , use hat , shades , if going in sun."
I hope everyone had a Merry Christmas! What did you do for Christmas today?,"Stayed home and everyone came here.  We had a great day.
What did you do skip?"
,Too much food to eat and watch tv football
,Stayed home and cooked for the family.  It was a nice day.
,We had our big shindig here on Christmas eve but my mother was sick and couldn't make it so we visited her Christmas day and gave her her gifts. One was a birthday gift for today.
,"Lol! I have answered this question three times already and got interrupted before I could press send! ??
That being said, we enjoyed a day of laughter and watching our children be kids, feeling very honored to be their parents. ??"
,I had a great Holiday but exhausting. Tried my hand at a Roast Christmas Goose. Came out great but a lot of work. 
How can I increase my height at the age of 18? I am a boy and my present height is 5'6,"This is a very valid question and there are some ways to influence your height:
You can change your posture and straighten your body.
You can stimulate your body in producing growth hormone.
You can make your spine longer.
Your genes will help you by reacting on your action.
If you are not an adult yet, you can increase the effects of each of these actions."
,"There's nothing that you can do about your height. Growth hormone works varied & on it's own. It has nothing to do with relatives or anything else either. But still you can follow some factors to make sure you are trying & be hopeful that might helps you through your growing process.
1.Make sure enough protein, vitamin & calcium getting into your body. Just a good nutrition is crucial.
2.Get plenty of sleep. The ideal would be 8-10 hours.
3.Get plenty of water daily. Never let your body gets dehydrated.
4.Do stretches each morning right after you wake up & also during the day.
5.Follow & get valid yoga movements. Which that might help for growing as well.
6.Do pull ups.
7.Also products such as turnips, collard green, green beans & broccoli known as products that might impress the growth hormone.
-All i said above, they are not 100 % helpful. They are only a ""hope"" of doing something. Controlling our lifestyle & doing something is better than doing nothing. Plus, there has been several examples that those factors & some other as well, helped some people in some way.
-Tip: Hopefully you didn't lift heavy weight in your growing age, doing heavy weights on workout in growing age will stunt your growing process.
-Tip: All the human hormones will continue growing till the age of ""25"" that's where everything in a human will finish developing. Now usually people will finish growing on 18-20. But sometimes growing hormones will not finish in 17-18-20 age but it will continue along other hormones till 25.
-Tip: Mostly hormones grow very varied. You grow some height , you stop, then you will grow beard while most of people in your age has no beard, but you are shorter than most of the males in your age. Then you have beard but your voice is not developed fully but others have manly voices & taller but no beard! Then suddenly they stop growing but you just start growing suddenly & get taller than all of them! . . What i mean is the hormones get developed without any specific routine. So you have to check to have a healthy lifestyle & be patient with yourself.
Example: I know someone being 6.0 while he's been below 20. When he reached his 20, he grown height & reached 6.4 then in age of 24 turned 6.5."
,most people stop growing at the age of 21 so just exercise a lot and eat healthy. I'm 6'2'' and the tallest person in my family by a long shot. I also have a long time until I'm done growing and I eat LOTS of broccoli so maybe that could help.
,"Height increases up to the age of 18 in women and up to the age of 24 in men. Increase in height can be attributed to the production of a hormone, called the Human Growth Hormone, which is secreted by the pituitary gland within the human body.
How to Increase Height after the Age of 18 Years?
It is really difficult to increase height after the age of 18, primarily due to the fact that the bones stop growing at this age. Surgeries and growth hormones which promise height growth in adults are potentially dangerous and detrimental for the body. However, with a few tricks and tips, it is possible to add a few inches or at least appear taller.
I think Proper diet and nutrition play a vital role in improving your height.
Proper Diet and Nutrition:
In order to get protein, carbohydrates, amino acids and calcium required for healthy growth and development, attention should be paid on consuming the following food items.
.Carrots
.Egg yolk
.Beef
.Fish
.Liver
.Green vegetables
.Potatoes
.Nuts such as almonds and peanuts
.Chicken
.Beans
.Peas
.Fruits like apples and bananas
.Milk and dairy products
**Stretching and Exercise:
**yoga:
**proper sleep:"
,"If I were you, I'd give up on this idea. Simply don't think about it, exercise and eat a lot of protein, keep my head up high and a straight posture, like mentioned above. Don't obsess over it, because in my observation, even if you grow an inch or two more, you'll never be quite satisfied if your goal is to become truly tall."
,"You are probably not finished growing.
And Tom Cruise is 5' 7"""
,"Most guys finish growing in height around the age of 21. Eat a balanced diet, get a good amount of sleep and exercise, and your body will reach its maximum height. What exactly that height is we can't tell you. Genetics will play a huge factor there. In my family the guys are on average 5'10""-5'11"". There is the occasional one that makes it over 6'0"" or is only 5'6""-5'8""."
Its national whiners day. National thanku note day . national candy cane day. And boxing day. Do u know any whiners??????????????????????,"Yes, I work with a couple whiners."
,"I can't stand whiners. Thank goodness not around any anymore.
All my candy canes are gone.:(
Don't care about boxing.
I have a couple of thank you notes to write, so that's what I will do."
,"I think whiners should be recorded and have to hear what they sound like. Bet they stop! Or at least cut back.
No candy canes. I HAVE to lose weight! No if and's or but's.
I don't like boxing.
So it looks like I will write a thank you note! ?"
,"Yeah, we all encounter a few along the way ... The ones who never learn to be grateful for their blessings."
I hope everyone had a Merry Christmas! What did you do for Christmas today?,"Stayed home and everyone came here.  We had a great day.
What did you do skip?"
,Too much food to eat and watch tv football
,Stayed home and cooked for the family.  It was a nice day.

,I had a great Holiday but exhausting. Tried my hand at a Roast Christmas Goose. Came out great but a lot of work. 
"So, how many of you bought yourself a present? Not me!",I did! I bought me a new pair of shoes. ??
,Incontinence supples for me and kitty goodies for motormouth
,I did buy myself a new crock pot  .... So I could fix dinner for my family.
,I did. I bought myself an old Coca-Cola metal sign for the bar area.
,I bought me a couple movies that were on sale on Vudu.

,Eggnog is fine once a year. A seasonal drink to enjoy sparingly. It's liquid Christmas.
"With so much knowledge now about the origins of holidays (Christmas, for example came from the pagan Winter Solstice festival) how is it that Christians still claim these holidays are Christian, when most people know that they aren't?","Christmas has always been pagan and always will be. Many don't care, you can free food and clothes, bonus money, shopping aka sales and a legitimate way to get off work to visit your family and friends or just get off work, its about getting holiday pay or vacations and with merchants its about the mighty dollar. There're ones who enjoy the hoola and fun of all holidays!"
,"Let's say they were ""Christianized"". Most of the practice of Christianity was born this way. You keep what you conquer.
It's harmless enough and secular observations of holidays are overtaking the pastoral aspect more and more each year. Santa is more prominent than Jesus in December."
,"Simplest answer: Brainwashing.
Actually, there ARE some Christian sects that recognize the pagan roots of holidays and refuse to celebrate them.  In fact, it was only within the last century or so that Christmas became a major holiday when it became commercialized.
IMO, that's the problem with other religious holidays ... They HAVEN'T been commercialized.  If they were, the importance of them would be diluted - as would the importance of those religions - and then it wouldn't be so ""important"" that people kill each other for religions."
,"The Christians (and probably other religious movements too) have always adapted ""things from the past"" for their own use. It is thought that the greater number of ancient churches in the UK are sited upon what had previously been earlier ""ritual sites"", and for the same reason. The places are usually easily seen from their immediate neighbourhood on the highest ground available.
The invention of Christianity around 2000 years ago (and heavily modified since) merely changed the ritual. The next ""big thing"" in terms of faith will probably re-purpose the sites again.
As to the re-purposing of holidays, why not? Just change the perceived deity and carry on."
,"Christians don't do that,  I think what you are referring to is something that the bible says would be happening after the death of the apostles.  These scriptures explain it
2Tim 4: 3,4  - For there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the wholesome teaching, but according to their own desires, they will surround themselves with teachers to have their ears tickled. 4 They will turn away from listening to the truth and give attention to false stories.
Acts 20:30 - From among you yourselves men will rise and speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves
2Pet 2:1,2 - There will also be false teachers among you. These very ones will quietly bring in destructive sects and will disown even the owner that bought them…..Also, with covetousness they will exploit you with counterfeit words."
,"Well why would it matter, the entire religion has it's roots in what they call pagan religion. The OT is chock full of other religious beliefs, the creation myth is directly from ancient Egyptian beliefs, the flood from Sumerian religions,  Most of the rest is rooted in the Canaanite religion of Ugrate. The messiah story is based on many other religions from around the region and given a new twist. So why would it surprise anyone that their holidays are pagan in origin?"
,"Because when you are deep within the bubble of delusion as many christians are all things, especially the lie, become possible."
,"A small number do not celebrate pagan holiday's and follow the teachings of the bible. Still, Jesus did say his following would be few in number.  The Roman Catholic Church (Catholic means universal, hence it incorporates all religion). Constantine worshipped Helios, other names are Apollo son of Saturn ie Chronos. The Jehovah witnesses were started by a freemason,  and the freemason belief goes back to the widows son and Jubal and Jabal, ""the craft"" and two pillars represented in Solomons temple, Solomon turned to pagan worship envoking demons with the seal on his ring (see lesser keys of Solomon), nothing to do with the salvation of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ and his brother James taught ""obedience.""

,"They do so because they like what those pagans do in their celebrations even though they are not in agreement with bible teachings.  So to get around it they make the claim that those holidays like Christmas are Christian and are based on God's word, iwhch is not the truth.  John 8:32,  "" and you will know the truth and the truth will set you free."""
,"When Christ was born, the magic were so incredibly happy that they gave HIM gifts. We carry on in this tradition.
Your problem is most likely the shopping, ECT that has little if any to do with the Christ Child. I agree. Its just a tradition for us Christians, that's all I know."
,Most celebrations were stemmed out of a dumb notions and made into festivities. An opportunists saw money in it and commercialised it.
,"The bible says Shepherds were watching their flocks by night, well sheep would not be out grazing in December, so yes Christmas was used to covert the pagan holiday saturnalia,  or the birth of sol invictus the unconquered sun."

Was this a serious question?"
,"Joyce, all of the main functions of the Israeli Gov’t, the Knesset, the PM’s residence, and principal govt departments are located in Jerusalem. Have been for years.
The problem is (surprise!) religion. The pitiful Palestinians (Muslims who, for lack of a better description, are a conquered people) still proclaim Jerusalem as the capital of their “Promised land” (though they have no actual govt) and their claims are buttressed by the parasitic Muslim faith of the region, whose tenuous claim to the city is a fantastical story in the Quran that says Muhammad flew on a white horse to Jerusalem (766 miles from Mecca and back in one night! Simply astounding) to ascend into heaven, from what is now the Dome of the Rock, built (suspiciously enough) atop the old (Jewish) Temple of Solomon.  As firm a basis of a land claim as ever there was.  
Trump merely stated what is obvious. Jerusalem is the functioning Capital of Israel. PM Netanyahu was elated.
But as is their way, the local Muslims (Palestinians and their sycophants) over-responded to a simple statement by a known fool and compulsive liar (Trump) by feigning insult and rioting and burning shops and garbage and cars in their own neighborhoods. Brilliant.

What Is My Lucky Day For Gambling?,"To work out your lucky day for gambling, you'll need a little bit of perseverance.

Although it might sound like a lot of baloney to most people, I'm a big believer in cosmic messages.

I also honestly believe that all things in this world are interconnected - if you just look deeper into things, there's always a pattern in every system.

Feeling lucky today? If you're trying to work out your lucky gambling day, there are two things you can do:

Firstly, look out for numerical signs. The universe is constantly sending us messages during our daily life, but - as we aren't 'looking' for them - we often miss them!

Anything from the number of buses that pass you on the street through to the ticket number you get when you're in a queue at the deli can give you an indication of your lucky day.

How to find your lucky gambling day
The second, and probably more important thing to do, is to collect data about your betting patterns.

It might not be as simple as checking which day you win the most money on (often, a lucky day comes once every 3 or 4 months), but if you persevere and analyse enough data - I can 100% guarantee that a pattern will start to emerge.

Once you think you've worked out your lucky day - put it to the test. Try out a few 'safe bets' at first, and if the universe is giving you the green light, then ride that wave!

As with any gambling tactic - the trick is also to know when to draw the line. The best gamblers are using a combination of luck and brains, so to be truly successful, you'll need to use a bit of both too!"
,"Money Talisman, Good Luck Charms for Money, Citrine, Green Aventurine ... Naturally Energized Crystals to Attract Good Luck in Money......"

What are ways To make your Teeth go crooked?,Sucking your thumb will make your teeth go crooked!
,"We all want a radiant smile.  While much of the radiance of a smile
comes from within, whether we are letting our ‘Light’ shine or not, many
of us still want a physically nice smile too.  So when we turn our
attention to dental braces, we come across another highly controversial
subject in the oral health world.
Orthodontic treatment in young children is known as interceptive
orthodontics, and it can begin as early as age 6 or 7. At this age,
teeth are still developing and the jaw is still growing. That means
certain conditions, such as crowding, may be easier to address.

      It is important to note that early treatment does not apply to all orthodontic problems; however, it may help in certain cases.
Let’s start by stating an obvious fact but one that many of us don’t think about commonly.
Our teeth can and do move.  While we don’t want to encourage our teeth to be mobile, they can shift in the mouth.
The unhealthy way teeth shift is through either abrupt or repeated pressure."
,"Not cleaning them properly Courtney and that also affects the gums, or they simply grew in that way...if you have lovely straight teeth, why do you want them to be crooked, if at all? See a dentist, there's nothing like a lovely smile and great teeth. But an imperfection or two - crooked if teeth and gums are health, then great, that's adds to character and its you."

It is quite easy to rent a DVD or buy one instead of tolerating the inferior quality of a video cassette. In order to convert VHS tapes to DVD, you need an analog video converter. Then you can copy the video to a digital file and compress it to MPEG-2 format. Next, you can use a burning software to copy the files on a blank DVD disc.

Install a video capture device in your computer. This device should come with recording software. The video capture device could be internally installed or an external instrument. Connect the out A/V connectors to input A/V of the video capture device and then choose the video source of the software. The files will be saved in the AVI format. The software that can be used for conversion are usually DVD maker plus or Pinnacle Studio."

"With so much knowledge now about the origins of holidays (Christmas, for example came from the pagan Winter Solstice festival) how is it that Christians still claim these holidays are Christian, when most people know that they aren't?","Christmas has always been pagan and always will be. Many don't care, you can free food and clothes, bonus money, shopping aka sales and a legitimate way to get off work to visit your family and friends or just get off work, its about getting holiday pay or vacations and with merchants its about the mighty dollar. There're ones who enjoy the hoola and fun of all holidays!"
,"Let's say they were ""Christianized"". Most of the practice of Christianity was born this way. You keep what you conquer.
It's harmless enough and secular observations of holidays are overtaking the pastoral aspect more and more each year. Santa is more prominent than Jesus in December."
,"Simplest answer: Brainwashing.
Actually, there ARE some Christian sects that recognize the pagan roots of holidays and refuse to celebrate them.  In fact, it was only within the last century or so that Christmas became a major holiday when it became commercialized.
IMO, that's the problem with other religious holidays ... They HAVEN'T been commercialized.  If they were, the importance of them would be diluted - as would the importance of those religions - and then it wouldn't be so ""important"" that people kill each other for religions."
,"The Christians (and probably other religious movements too) have always adapted ""things from the past"" for their own use. It is thought that the greater number of ancient churches in the UK are sited upon what had previously been earlier ""ritual sites"", and for the same reason. The places are usually easily seen from their immediate neighbourhood on the highest ground available.
The invention of Christianity around 2000 years ago (and heavily modified since) merely changed the ritual. The next ""big thing"" in terms of faith will probably re-purpose the sites again.
As to the re-purposing of holidays, why not? Just change the perceived deity and carry on."
,"Christians don't do that,  I think what you are referring to is something that the bible says would be happening after the death of the apostles.  These scriptures explain it
2Tim 4: 3,4  - For there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the wholesome teaching, but according to their own desires, they will surround themselves with teachers to have their ears tickled. 4 They will turn away from listening to the truth and give attention to false stories.
Acts 20:30 - From among you yourselves men will rise and speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves
2Pet 2:1,2 - There will also be false teachers among you. These very ones will quietly bring in destructive sects and will disown even the owner that bought them…..Also, with covetousness they will exploit you with counterfeit words."
,"Well why would it matter, the entire religion has it's roots in what they call pagan religion. The OT is chock full of other religious beliefs, the creation myth is directly from ancient Egyptian beliefs, the flood from Sumerian religions,  Most of the rest is rooted in the Canaanite religion of Ugrate. The messiah story is based on many other religions from around the region and given a new twist. So why would it surprise anyone that their holidays are pagan in origin?"
,"Because when you are deep within the bubble of delusion as many christians are all things, especially the lie, become possible."
,"A small number do not celebrate pagan holiday's and follow the teachings of the bible. Still, Jesus did say his following would be few in number.  The Roman Catholic Church (Catholic means universal, hence it incorporates all religion). Constantine worshipped Helios, other names are Apollo son of Saturn ie Chronos. The Jehovah witnesses were started by a freemason,  and the freemason belief goes back to the widows son and Jubal and Jabal, ""the craft"" and two pillars represented in Solomons temple, Solomon turned to pagan worship envoking demons with the seal on his ring (see lesser keys of Solomon), nothing to do with the salvation of Jesus Christ.

,"They do so because they like what those pagans do in their celebrations even though they are not in agreement with bible teachings.

National flashlite day. National homeless persons day . and national french frech fried shrimp day.. I know i have been homeless before. So any of of these floats ypur boat??????????????????????????????????????,"  Good morning Otis! I use a flashlight every morning and night when I walk around with my dog Sadie so she can do her thing  I love shrimp no matter how it is done.  And I've never been homeless, but I wish everyone had a place to call home.
                 "
,"I have a flashlight near my bed just in case.
Love shrimp anyway they are fixed.
Never been homeless, I can't imagine what that's like. I also help when I can."
,"I also use a flashlight to take my dog out at night. I like fried shrimp, and I wish everyone had a roof over their head and a warm place to sleep."
,I have a heart for the homeless and try to help .... And I'm never without a flashlight on my early morning treks with my daughter and our dog.  Guess this is one of my days!
,"What makes me scratch my head the most is how often people make fun of California for having a lot of homeless people. The reality is that had they settled anywhere else, they wouldn’t be homeless people, they would be dead.
I’ve spent quite some time with them. When I was 10 or so my grandparents ran an antique shop downtown and I would ride my scooter around befriending all the weird and wacky homeless people. They called me scooter kid. For the most part, they’re not starving or lacking food. Not in the least bit. You can walk into the food bank my family volunteers at and walk out with 3 grocery bags full of nutritios food for a whole month. What most of these people suffer from are addiction and mental health problems. These problems are rather difficult to solve since you can place clinics on every corner, but the only way they work is if the individuals get themselves into the clinic by their own free will. There lies the problem.
Sad fact, 40% of homeless people in my area are veterans."
,"I thought I answered this question! ?? But I now remember I just fell asleep to it! Lol! YAH I slept!
Anyways a flashlight is one of those things I can never find when I actually need one. When I don't need one... I find a hundred! ??
So I use the flashlight on my phone.
My heart goes out to homeless people.

"When yrump recognizedJerusalem as the capital of Israel, Israel was pretty mad. My question is, y does it matter? To trump, to your neighbor? Y does it matter to anyone but israel?","That is called politics, interfering with other people/country's business."
,"On the contrary, Israel was delighted.
Was this a serious question?"
,"Joyce, all of the main functions of the Israeli Gov’t, the Knesset, the PM’s residence, and principal govt departments are located in Jerusalem. Have been for years.
The problem is (surprise!) religion. The pitiful Palestinians (Muslims who, for lack of a better description, are a conquered people) still proclaim Jerusalem as the capital of their “Promised land” (though they have no actual govt) and their claims are buttressed by the parasitic Muslim faith of the region, whose tenuous claim to the city is a fantastical story in the Quran that says Muhammad flew on a white horse to Jerusalem (766 miles from Mecca and back in one night! Simply astounding) to ascend into heaven, from what is now the Dome of the Rock, built (suspiciously enough) atop the old (Jewish) Temple of Solomon.  As firm a basis of a land claim as ever there was.  
Trump merely stated what is obvious. Jerusalem is the functioning Capital of Israel. PM Netanyahu was elated.
But as is their way, the local Muslims (Palestinians and their sycophants) over-responded to a simple statement by a known fool and compulsive liar (Trump) by feigning insult and rioting and burning shops and garbage and cars in their own neighborhoods. Brilliant. 
 (Isn’t it curious how those most sensitive to being disrespected tend to be their own worst enemies?)
Israelis, as is their daily lot, had to hunker down and deal with yet more violent Islamic social dysfunction outside their doors. "

What Is The Cause Of Hairloss Among Women? Does An Oily Scalp/ Hair Contribute To Hairloss?,"Today, most unfortunately, more and more women have started to suffer from hair loss and balding, a problem that was completely associated with middle aged and pot bellied men in the past.
Experts say that they have started to treat patients suffering from hair loss, who are as young as fifteen or sixteen, a time when the girls are in their prime of life and health.
As you must be aware, hair grows at the rate of one half inch every month, and after a certain period of time, ranging from two to six years, it goes into a state of rest, after which it starts to fall out from the hair follicle. This all happens so that a new hair can start to grow from the same place, but for some women, androgens are present in abundance, and when this happens, the natural cycle gets interrupted, and a build up of dihydrotestosterone or DHT takes place. This causes the woman to lose hair.
Experts say that it is vital to maintain hygiene on one's scalp, and when your scalp is oily, it may well lead to the formation of dandruff, which in turn will lead to more hair loss. However, this in itself is not a cause for hair loss."
,"A number of things can cause excessivehair loss. For example, about 3 or 4 months after an illness or a major surgery, you may suddenly lose a large amount of hair. This hair loss is related to the stress of the illness and is temporary.
Hormonal problems may cause hair loss. If your thyroid gland is overactive or underactive, your hair may fall out. This hair loss usually can be helped by treatmentthyroid disease. Hair loss may occur if male or female hormones, known as androgens and estrogens, are out of balance. Correcting the hormone imbalance may stop your hair loss."
,"Most people will experience
hair loss in their lives. Oily hair most likely has nothing to do with it, but
it is hard to say. Some people will lose a lot more than others and it applies
to both women and men. Women who lose hair in their younger years could have
thyroid issues, which increases stress, and consequently depletes essential
vitamins and minerals. This alone could cause significant hair loss in women,
no matter their age.
Basically, some stress,
whether it is due to an illness or other not, has the potential to cause hair
loss in anyone. Hair loss is often much more dramatic and noticeable in men but
it can still be a disconcerting because it is hard to know the exact cause
without seeing a professional. Many people use special shampoos and treatments
to help stimulate regrowth and to prevent hair from falling out. Sample Hime or something similar and see if this helps."

"When yrump recognizedJerusalem as the capital of Israel, Israel was pretty mad. My question is, y does it matter? To trump, to your neighbor? Y does it matter to anyone but israel?","That is called politics, interfering with other people/country's business."
,"On the contrary, Israel was delighted.
Was this a serious question?"
,"Joyce, all of the main functions of the Israeli Gov’t, the Knesset, the PM’s residence, and principal govt departments are located in Jerusalem. Have been for years.
The problem is (surprise!) religion. The pitiful Palestinians (Muslims who, for lack of a better description, are a conquered people) still proclaim Jerusalem as the capital of their “Promised land” (though they have no actual govt) and their claims are buttressed by the parasitic Muslim faith of the region, whose tenuous claim to the city is a fantastical story in the Quran that says Muhammad flew on a white horse to Jerusalem (766 miles from Mecca and back in one night! Simply astounding) to ascend into heaven, from what is now the Dome of the Rock, built (suspiciously enough) atop the old (Jewish) Temple of Solomon.  As firm a basis of a land claim as ever there was.  
Trump merely stated what is obvious. Jerusalem is the functioning Capital of Israel. PM Netanyahu was elated.
But as is their way, the local Muslims (Palestinians and their sycophants) over-responded to a simple statement by a known fool and compulsive liar (Trump) by feigning insult and rioting and burning shops and garbage and cars in their own neighborhoods. Brilliant. 
 (Isn’t it curious how those most sensitive to being disrespected tend to be their own worst enemies?)
Israelis, as is their daily lot, had to hunker down and deal with yet more violent Islamic social dysfunction outside their doors. "

Is Billie Joe Armstrong Getting A Divorce?,"Church on sunday was writtten by Billie Joe Armstrong to convince Adrienne not to leave him, and she didn't. They're still together.
Billy Joe met Adrienne at a concert back in 1990.  Speculation regarding their separation was sparked when the couple put their house up for sale last year, however, there are no new news stories stating that they have broken up so it is to be assumed that they are still together.
Adrienne has been asked before if she takes offence at the lyrics that Billie Joe writes and if she worries that they are about their relationship and she has said that he has to write what he feels and that he is just being honest.
many fans dislike Adrienne feeling that she is rude, horrible, totally full of herself and smug, highly arrogant as she has been seen being horrible to fans.It is also suggested that she chooses who gets to meet Greenday and many feel she has no right to decide who gets to met them and who doesn't.  One fan stated ""She is not even an offical celebrity and no one has come to see her.  She either needs to get an agent or a real job"".  Another felt ""She has no right going around in the Crowds cos most fans have not come to see her so she need to get over herself"".
Her husband is rumoured to have been with Groupies and she takes out her mistrust out on the fans and assumes that everyone wants to and is going to be with her husband.  She is mostly spotted having fans removed by security at concerts, walking around in the crowd a signings, being rude to the females who are stupid enough to beleive she is famous.  She thinks she is a big massive famous celebrity and Billie The Doormat will not reel in his wifes fat narcussistic neck in.  She thinks she is in Green Day and gets busy ""interacting with fans"" on fan blog, fan pages etc dispite the reality is that the fans are not her fans to interacting with.  Most fans suck up to her to get to Billie Joe. 
They are also rumoured to be in an open marriage and Billie Joe is seen with several different women.  They are still together but they truly need to just go their seperate ways.  It would be a good idea if that woman stops poking her nose and interfering with his career.  She is not an official celebrity but fans have to suck up to this smug, narcussistic bitch in order to be a fan of Green Day.  She is the Yoko Ono of Green Day and most fans just wish she would fuck off.  She is turning off fans and Billie thinks it is funny when she gets security to push fans out of his way.  He doesn't about the very people who buy their alubms and lifestyle. 
She thinks she is famous and does things like charity endorsements, interviews in magazines, via the web and on TV.  She is always trying to get her frigging face down the lens off the back of her husband because she think she is famous.  IN reality for most people think she a god darn annoyance.  The problem is, there are enough silly girls willing to pander to her to make her think she is an important and special and famous celebrity.  I don't see Billie Joe Armstrong waking up anytime soon.  She is a fame-hungry, materialistic hypocrite and anyone who tells the truth about their dislike for her, they get verbally attacked by internet users lecturing you on how to be a True Fan and by users who claim to know them or claim to be them. 
Why the hell cannot she just go do one and actually get on with her own career (if she has one in the first place) and stop poking her nose in and interfering in her husbands?  Why does she feel the need to ""interact with fans"" - they are not her fans to interact with.  DUH!"
,"You guys are so freaking full of it. Probably a bunch of wishful thinkers who want BJ single so Adrienne won't get in between you and your fantasies of him. Billie Joe will never divorce Adrienne, and she is not nasty. She is beautiful. And by the way, you may think ""21 Guns"" is about their divorce, but guess what ""When It's Time"" is about? Reading your comments just make me sick. Furthermore, it's natural she would only progress through his career, but need I remind you she's been with him since before they were famous? You REALLY think she has bad intentions?

So they fight. All married couples do. As long as BJ forgives her and continues to love her, you should respect him for it. You're Green Day fans, right? Act like it.

Read what he says about her.
I think their romance is beautiful."
,You guys honestly are no longer fans because of some fat cow? Really? Did you ever consider he's still with her for the kids? Just ignore her. Obviously if you can't like a band for their music anymore there is something seriously wrong with this world.
,She's a beast and he should finally leave her.  All you ever hear is stories about them fighting.  He married her when he was pretty much unknown and he has totally outgrown her.  As his popularity grew she became more and more resentful of his fame and all of his female fans.  Time to move on Billie.  You can do much better than her.
,"Whoever is the guest who posted that Billie's female fans are ""skanks and groupies"" you should be ashamed of yourself and I can not believe you call yourself a Green Day fan when you say something like that about other Green Day fans.   Nobody has ""poisonous jealousy"" for Adrienne.  She is quite unattractive and over weight nobody would have reason to be jealous of her.  Billie should divorce her before he loses all is fans."
,"No...I don't think they are getting divorced he still seems to be married to ""Minnesota Fats"".  Although the majority of fans just wish he would dump her sorry ass already.  It was said a couple of years ago that they came close to divorcing and most fans were hoping he would have just gone through with it. She is a fat, nasty pig and Billie deserves so much better than the monster he's married to."
,"I think Billie only adds fuel to the fire by being so public about his fights with her.  I have heard rumors for years about their getting divorced.  Personally, I think he should just divorce her already.  He's way too good for her.  I think she is very resentful of Billie's popularity and is very unkind to his female fans.  Besides being the ugliest woman on the planet, she is also the phoniest woman on the planet and she's very much full of herself.  I was at a record signing for Green Day this past tour.  She was walking around like she was some kind of celebrity, like people were actually there to see her.  But in reality everyone was just like, ""Where's Billie?""  She was nice to you if you were a parent or a child but she was absolutely rude to anyone who was in their twenties or early thirties and was attractive.  Any of those pretty girls she just rolled her eyes and scowled at them.  It really looked as if she was going threw the crowd to check out who was going up to her husband.  I just moved as far as I could to get away from her.  She looks very sloppy and dirty and I was afraid a lice bug would pop out of her hair and jump onto me.  I was not at all impressed by her behavior.  I have no idea what Billie see in her.  She looks like a monster and she isn't even a nice person.  If he is not divorcing her he should.  She will eventually turn off all his fans and train wreck his career.  He deserve so much better."
,"I heard that they are actually separating.  I am not sure if it is divorce or if they are just separating.  Personally, I think Billie should just leave her.  He can do so much better.  I don't think it's jealousy on the part of the female fans at all.  Rather I think it's jealousy on her part towards the female fans.  Billie has become a huge star and I think she knows he can do a lot better than her and takes it out on his female fans.  I think she is resentful of his success and tries to keep the attractive female fans away from him as much as possible.  I have seen her up close and in person and she is the most unattractive woman alive.  She is also a complete phony.   She is nice to all the kid fans, parents with children - but completely rude and nasty to all the attractive female fans.  She should take a hint - 90% of Billie fans are female.  If she keeps being nasty to them he will lose all his fan base.  I agree if Billie was smart he would just leave her already."
,"It has been said that the 21 Guns song is really about their impeding divorce.  Many people say that they are no longer together and the sudden sale of the house they have lived in for the past fifteen years is a sure sign of that.  She is a fat, nasty pig and Billie Joe should divorce her."
,"Why can't you guys just accept Adrienne? She is a beautiful woman and absolutely nice!
Most of her haters are just 13-14, get that Billie would NEVER EVER do anything with you. He isn't a perv, his kids are the same age.
Get of your fu**in' dream-cloud and get a real life, that's just childish.
Love Green Day and Billie Joe with Adrienne or just get another favorite band!
Become a real fan or stop being nasty!"
,"Well, I here its going on but it might true after Billie made the 21 guns video so if doses true that I heard(:"
,"It's funny some of you guys say she's ruining his career. How is that so? They got married only a year after Green Day got famous and signed onto Reprise. If she was ruining his career it would have been bad from the beginning.  Songs like She, When It's Time, Pulling Teeth, Minnesota Girl, about all of Green Day's love songs are inspired by her.  Billie even said so himself that he was very suicidal when he was younger and full of empty rage. It was only a miracle he met Adrienne when he did. He wasn't as confident as people thought. Without her, he would be nothing.  She's done nothing but take excellent care of him and their children. As long as he loves her, you should be happy for him and shouldn't even think about why they should get a divorced.She doesn't act all lovey-dovey in public because she doesn't like the attention. She likes to keep their love life private. And I don't blame her.  If she was just using him, she would've drawn the line years ago when he first had a million dollars not years after. She would've took it and left if that was what she wanted. They've been married for years and they truly love each other. Nothing is ever going to change that. I bet my life on it.  :P"
,"Wow, some of you guys are pathetic to be sitting here making crap up.   You don't know Adrienne or Billie Joe so why are you making up rumors?   And for those of you who wonder if she would stay with him if he was poor, just remember, they met when he was 18, aka in 1990 WAY before Green Day was as big as they are now.   Their private life has absolutely nothing to do with any of you. Yes, he is famous, so yes, people are going to be in his business, but I guess I don't understand why you all care so much if he gets a divorce?   It has NOTHING to do with you!

=)"
,"It was posted on one day that they are no longer together.  That certainly would explain why their house was put up for sale all of a sudden during the middle of Green Days world tour and just when his kids were starting a new school year.  Also when his house was put up for sale and the local papers listed it, one of the several of the fan sites put up the article.  A day later they were all removed.  It seems they want to divorce quietly?????"
,I don't know if they are divorcing but I'm so sick of hearing about this droning woman.  She is not accomplished and has done nothing of merit in her life beside get pregnant (at the time) by an up and coming rock star.  She would not have a clothing store or a clothing line with out Billie's money or his name behind it.  No charity would ever be interested in her if she was not married to Billie Joe Armstrong.  So her accomplishments are really Billie Joe's accomplishments.   As for the way the females fans are treated - it's totally disgusting.  Billie Joe needs to wake up and see that a musician is absolutely nothing with out his fans.  Billie Joe said in interviews that before he made it he sold joints for two bucks and if he wasn't a musician he would probably be a drug dealer. (This is not made up - he actually said all these things in interviews - you can look it up.)  I'm just wondering when he loses all his fan base and had to return to his former occupation would she still stay with him.  Would she have even been with him if he never made it and was still doing his former occupation?  Chances are - I think not.   She has stayed with him because he is her meal ticket and it stupid girl fans who she is nasty to who are funding her fancy lifestyle.  If he was smart he would leave her.
,I am not sure if they are divorcing or not.  I hear some people saying they are and some people saying they aren't.  I agree with most of the comments above that he should finally leave her already.  Billie has admitted in concerts and interviews that they have a lot of nasty fights.  I would tell anyone in that situation that they should just walk away . I hardly think that the fans are jealous of her.  I think it's the other way around.  She looks like a monster.  I'm sure it bothers her that her husband has so many choices of beautiful women to choose from.  He bends over backwards to make her happy and she doesn't seem to appreciate it.  He should just really dump her already.  He's career has taken off and he's totally outgrown her. He could do much better.
,How is Adrienne accomplished?  What has she done with her life other than having Billie Joe's children.   She had a failed clothing line and anything she tried to do she couldn't have done with out Billie Joe's money.  And she certainly is not beautiful.  Actually she is quite a horror.  He should divorce her already.  I am a little curious how some people on the internet claim to know so many details of their personal life.  It makes me think that you are not just some random person because no fan could possibly know details of his personal life like where he spends Christmas and details of his kid's school.  Sounds more to me like you are actually his Mrs. Or someone very close to her.  And that makes her completely pathetic.  No wonder she is turning away Billie's fans by the drove.
,"I haven't heard anything official that they are divorcing so I don't think so.  But I do agree with the majority of the comments on here that he should have left her a long time ago.  Probably around the time he wrote the song Redundant.  She is definitely holding his career back and will ultimately just destroy it because she seems to be turning off so many of his fans.  And the likely hood of Billie having a solo career or having any success with a solo project is highly unlikely as long as he is involved with her.  I guess Billie just doesn't realize how many of his fans are female and how this monster he is married to is just turning people off Green Day.  He will wake up when he sees all his fans are gone.  I love Billie Joe with all my heart.  He's a brilliant musician and a hell of a good looking guy, be I will not support his wife's fancy lifestyle anymore. Anyone who is that nasty to fans does not deserve it.  It makes me so sad that Billie Joe has to suffer because of this horrible woman."
,"I'm not really sure if they are divorcing or not. But you can't go by what you see on TV or what the media says. They claim so many celebrity couples are so happy and in love and the truth is actually quite the opposite.  E.g. Brad Pitt/Jennifer Aniston, Tiger Woods and his Mrs.  So I think you will never really know the truth.  I did see on another website that the song Last Night On Earth is actually an admission to Billie having an affair.  If you listen to the words it only states ""You are the moonlight of my life"" - someone you can only see at night or in secret.  It does not state you are my everything day and night.  And the whole song refers to love being sent to someone who is obviously not close to him.  So maybe they are not divorcing but maybe there is someone else?????"
,"Most people are saying that they are divorcing.  She was not with him at the American Music Awards and many people are saying that Billie looked very angry and upset at the awards. Besides Billie has given his fans many reasons to believe their is trouble in his marriage with all the tales of the fights he has had with her.  If he is not divorcing her, he should.   She looks like Medusa. Billie seriously has to have a talk with her about personal hygiene and cleanliness.  She's a dirt bag.  She looks like she has never bathed in her life and there's lice in that nasty hair of hers.  BILLIE CAN DO MUCH BETTER THAN THAT UGLY NASTY PIG!!!!"
,"I heard they are always fighting and their is  a lot of talk about a divorce.  But thank you for letting us know that they are building another house closer to the boys school.  I know now to stop buying everything Green Day related.  I don't think that fat slob of a woman deserves a big fancy house and I don't want my money contributing to fancy houses, cars or schools for her brats.   She is incredibly nasty to the female fans of Green Day and ultimately will destroy Billie's brilliant career.  He is stupid (and apparently blind) for staying with her."
,Adrienne will not divorce Billie because she is so fat and ugly she couldn't get anyone else even if she tried. Billie will not leave her because she is the only woman dumb and pathetic enough to stay with him when he admits that he is attracted to other men and makes out with men right in front of her.  Ever notice that she has a problem with all the female fans but never has issue with him kissing other men.  HE'S GAY PEOPLE. SHE IS JUST A BEARD FOR HIM.
,"There are all kinds of rumors going around about Billie Joe including that he is leaving Green Day and going solo.  I think it's absolutely hysterical that this man thinks he can actually have a solo career when his wife is turning his fans off by the dozen.   I do agree with the comment that it makes absolutely no sense to show a married man with kids so much attention.  I think that all the fans should give his wife exactly what she wants and leave him alone.  See what kind of career he will have then.  Let him retire to that fancy house he's building ""closer to his kids school"".  But the fans should definitely stop funding his fat hog of a wife's fancy lifestyle and kid's fancy schools."
,Honestly who really cares?I agree with all  little fan girls tht billie is HAWT.but hes also obviously in love with adrienne.if he isn't then fine yay billie joe.but let them b 4 now if you really  his fans.o and btw don't stop buying gd merch just because you h8 his wife.your ruining billies life 2
,"There are some rumors going around that the song ""21 Guns"" is about Addie and Billie Joe getting a divorce, but Billie hasn't said anything about the rumors to deny or confirm them."
,"You people are awful! Adrienne seems like a lovely woman, and certainly isn't unattractive! I smell jealousy."
,"I think he should divorce Adrienne.  She is a fat, disgusting worthless piece of s**t."
,"Well, sorry to be so blunt, but if mentioning to journalists how bad your marriage is, to earn more money, then that's pathetic. There's better ways to earn money. Like a paper boy, for example. C'mon Billie. Are you serious dude?"
,"Hmmmm...interesting conversation.  I don't think they are getting divorced or anything.  But I do agree that she's is definitely killing his career.  She seem to be the Yoko Ono of Green Day.   I have heard that she is very nasty to the female fans.  And in regards to the comment above that  Adrienne ""needs to keep the skanks and bitches at bay"" that alone is reason for Billie to lose every fan he has.  I have never in my life heard of any spouse of a rock star refer to the female fans of the group as skanks and bitches.  Is this lady for real?  Girls, listen to me - you are all smart, strong women who do not have to take these derrogatory insults from the wife of a rock star.  And I don't believe for one moment that anyone is jealous of her.  She is without a doubt the ugliest woman on the planet.  I think you should all just give her what she wants and just ignore her husband.  She has been insulting to some of you so stop voting for Green Day in awards, stop buying their albums, and stop attending their concerts.  Believe me that will get your message across stronger than all the venting that is being done here.  No rock star who allows his wife to treat deserves to have fans.  And if he is as happily married as
they say he is - isn't chasing a married man with children absolutely fruitless?  Focus on a rockstar or band that will appreciate your attention."
,"There were all kinds of rumors that the song 21 Guns was about their getting a divorce, but Billie has not confirmed or denied the rumors.  He should divorce her.  He is much too good for her.  She's fat and ugly and he could do much better than her.  And it is a bit strange that he would put up his house for sale while he is in the middle of a world tour.  He has lived there for so many years, it would just make more sense to sell it when the tour was over.  But it mysteriously went on the market in September, just when his kids were starting school and he was about to leave for several months to Europe and Asia.  The timing just seems very odd.  A separation or possible divorce from Adrienne would explain the house being put up for sale all of a sudden.  In any case she is a loser and he is much better off without her."
,"A good reason?  How about the fact that Billie admits that they fight like cats and dogs?  Sounds to me like he doesn't love her he just hangs around for the kids.   And nobody is jealous of her.  She is a fat, disgusting, slob.  Why would anyone be jealous of her?   The only thing I could say to the last response is if Billie doesn't care about losing his fans then he should.  He admitted in an interview he was not happy being the stay at home suburban dad.  So let him go back to being that or what ever the hell he was before he made it.  I think he was a bus boy or something.  Let 's see if she stays with him when he's a bus boy again.  As a matter of fact the last answer just made me think I was so stupid to be a fan of his.  If Billie doesn't care about his fans he doesn't deserve to have them and I we should be smart to support groups who do care about his fans."
,"I don't think they are divorcing but he probably should leave her.  I am just curious why when some of you said that you have experienced her being nasty to you why you still support Billie Joe the way you do.  Really? What smart, modern woman gives her full attention to a man who's wife is nasty to them?  Why?  I wouldn't give him the time of day if that were the case.  And if he is as happily married as some of these posts say then isn't absolutely fruitless showing a married man with children attention?  Use your time, energy, and attention elsewhere. Either on yourselves or on someone who appreciates it. Believe me Billie Joe isn't the end all to everything.  There are plenty of bans and rock stars out there who would love you for half the attention you give Billie Joe.  This woman has been crying and belly aching for you to leave her husband alone.  Give her what she wants, wasting your precious attention on him."
,"I don't think they are getting a divorce but I think he should leave her.  I have to be honest even the guys are sick and tired of hearing about this  whining, ugly  woman.  She is severely hurting Green Day's popularity with the women and if Billie was smart he would see that.  Sometimes I think she would not be happy until she completely ruins his career.  Billie is one of the most gifted songwriters of our generation.  It is so sad that such a genius is having his career ruined by a miserable spouse.  There was even rumors going around about Billie wanting to start a solo career.  I think the success of a solo career is highly unlikely as long as he's married to her.  I also worry about the popularity of Green Day suffering because of her.  I think most fans would be happy if she would just go away."
,"I think most of the fans think that he should just finally dump her.  She is totally turning off his fans and most fans can't stand her and are turning their back on Billie Joe because of her.  Green Day put out an amazing album with 21 Century Breakdown, but yet other than 21 Guns none of their singles seem to be charting.  Many fans are no longer voting for Green Day in fan based awards or polls.  And most fans are saying they will not see this new musical project of theirs because they refuse to support his fat slob wife's fancy lifestyle anymore.  She is already hurting his career and Green Day's success.  Personally I think he should dump her sorry ass before she totally kills his career all together."
,"Who are all these ""people"" saying that they are divorcing? I've heard nothing of the sort. In fact they were just pictured holding hands and looking quite in love while Billie and crew were in Australia. Maybe they fight, but that doesn't mean they're divorcing. Many married couples fight, but they still love each other at the end of the day."
,"I think most people agree that Billie should have dumped her years ago.  But I don't understand why some of you girls let her bother you so much.  She is fat, monstrously ugly and I don't any of you should be giving her the time of day.  I would say the best thing to do is to not give her any attention - just act like she doesn't exist.  If anything you should pity poor Billie for having to be married to such a beast!"
,"Oh my god people honestly,
1st of all if they have split up then why on earth is she on tour with them
with all their kids in tow too,
adrienne is lovely we waved at her in london at the gig on the barrier, and she waved back loads at us and smiled a lot,
her kids where also there,
why would she be stood side stage watching billie and the boys if they have Split up

they are happy together, stop spreading malicious sad gossip and grow up, they re married I doubt after all this time they re split up
so get a a life,."
,"Adrienne is the BEST girl that you can see,so I just can say you are nasty jealous because there are a lot of girls jealous of her .THEY W?LL NEVER DIVORCE AND ADIE IS THE BEST G?RL! He loves her you can understand by songs,sentences. They are the best ! Cut it out!"
,"OK so this is an old post, but I'm so angry I'm gonna have my say, as
the saying goes, better late than never.
This is disgusting,
you people call yourselves fans and you are slagging of the woman he
loves. You're all just jealous bit**es because you wish you could have
him yourselves.
They've been married 19 years and hopefully will still
be married in another 19 years and those who don't like it can F off.
I think they make a lovely couple!"
,"They should.  All she cares about is trying to get attention and fame off the back of Billie Joe and the kids.  Regarding the fact that it was a manager-led intervention last year, it only prooves she does not care about him as a person.  They only reason why the fans think she is a celebrity is because of her attention-seeking  and desperate need for the limelight because she enjoys it - doing interviews and getting flimed for documentaries and how Billie Joe seems to never get passed an interview without mention her.  She has worked with charities but as a celebrity and has made Green Day fundraise and campaign for the charities she supports.  She tweet to interact with Green Day fans and to tweet about her sons and Billie - she doesnt tweet about herself.  She is just an attention-seeker who has succeeed into getting the attention she thinks she deserves.  Stop bullying other fans into giving her attention as its out of order.  No fan should have to give a wife of a rock star attention in order to be allowed to be a fan of a band that they are not part of and milks for attention.  If Billie Joe died, she would milk his death for attention.  She is has Narcissistic Personality Disorder and anyone who can see her for what she is, are going to get abused.  And I cannot forgive a manager-led intervention.  Billie Joe should not be grovelling to her, it should be the other way around.  She is staying with him for attention, status and fame and the lifestyle.  She is also very manipulative as she has manipulated enough people to enable and back up her delusions of grandeur.  And yes, I do agree with the label of The Yoko Ono of Green Day as she will not stop and is allowed to get attention off of Billie Joe and his success and is allowed to interfere.  If she is so deperate for attention and fame can't she do it properly by signing to an agent to be an official celebrity she so desperately wants to be - off the back of Billie Joes' career?  Its his choice to stay with someone who does this and and she tweeted about an addictive perscription pill more than once and then went through her twitter deleting them..  Epic fail.  If he truly wants to be drink and drug free a radical change is needed but its obvious why he sticks with her and remember she came out of a punk scene too and was not straight edge....so go figure.  The fan shouldnt even know who she is.  Its ultimitately both their fault by letting her get attention in the first place and for being so public about their relationship.   All she cares about is the limelight and the attention that people give her.  She is not only in love with herself but in love with the limelight.  She makes me want to puke and more importantly what really annoys me is that there are enough sychophants to bully anyone who is rational enough to see her for what she is.  A limelight-loving attention-seeker using her family and grabs every opporunity she can to turn the attention and limelight onto her including all the interviews and the publicity etc -  at some point in the communication thread whether it is the journalist that drops or she allows for the journalist to drop -  publicity for that eco shop she has at some point Billie Joe Armstrong name is dropped and uses Emilys Army for gaining attention too.  Also there are plenty of Eco and fairtade and handmade artiscan shops around the Oakland and San Franisco area so why does her shop get so much attention and publicity?"
,To the people that talk negative about Adrienne have you actually met her or you just going by what you see online?.  Has anyone actually met Billie after 2012 and had a negative experience?.
,"My husband was so smooth at hiding his infidelity so I had no proof for months, I was referred to some hacker and decided to give him a try.. The result was incredible because all my cheating husband's text messages, whatsapp, facebook and even phone conversations was wired directly to my cellphone. Deephacking17 helped me put a round-the-clock monitoring on him and I got concrete evidence of his escapades..if your spouse is an expert at hiding his cheating adventures

,"You guys are assholes for talking like this. You say she's ugly, but are you sure you aren't looking in a mirror? Seeing your personality maybe? And she is no reason to stop loving Green Day, you pathetic gossips."
,Did anyone see the grammy awards? Adrienne was there and Billie kissed her when he/green day won. Still together.
,"Come on, honestly? Billie Joe and Adrienne are the cutest couple, and she's beautiful! They would never get a divorce! The way they met is the sweetest thing, by the way :)"
,I'm laughing my ass off at how many green day fans are wasting their time getting mad over this. I'm a huge ass green day fan and I think its completely ridiculous that you people take it so seriously.
,"Regardless of this woman's looks, age, or weight, it's personality to be concerned about. If she's a jerk, then she is, so then don't spend money on Green Day anymore. If she's kind, smart and funny, then she is, so be inspired by her. I can guarantee not one person writing here knows her personally.

Anyone telling these angry fans they're not Green Day fans because they dislike Adrienne is RETARDED. The fact everyone is getting so upset, on BOTH sides of the argument, shows each person is a concerned fan. The bottom line is, she's just another celebrity in the spotlight for people to disect. As Amy Lee says, ""If people are making fun of you, you're probably doing something right."""
,"Guys.... You really are so unfair
she's beautiful and lovely.
Personality I love bj and adrienne, if she never meet him, he never would be were he are now
cause she help him and love him very much
so, stoping this f*cking conversation"
,Jesus Christ peoplee theyy are never going to divorce theyy love eachh otherr if you likedd billie Joe you woould knoww that he has saidd menii timess Adrienne is the only woman he will ever lovee Therr happy andd therr a great couplee
,"Well the thing is any seperation or rumored divorce is only coming from her.  She has left him twice so far over the past 15 or so years and she has always has come back to him.  I cannot understand why he is still with someone who is allegedly horrible to his fans and acts as if she is some sort of celebrity, as if we actually care about what she thinks, feels or says.  Just because she is wife and muse of a musican does not gave her the right to act horrible, or give her copy wright rights to the music.  Her attitude sucks and she looks like a horrid drug-addled over-grown Groupie.  Being a muse to a musican is not a career option.....When she left him in May he was really really hurt by it and when he was on TV performing ""Last of The American Girls"" he looked as though he was going to break down in tears.  So any divorce would be coming from her.  It is a shame that he chooses to be with someone who is so smug, arrogant and nasty to fans and who people accuse others of being jealous of if we say anything else other than that she is such a wonderful, beautiful, kind, saintly, lovely person....etc.  We do not care.  And she seems to me that she has this attitude of ""Look at me, look WHO I'M with and your not...haa haa haa - smirk, smirk"" is horrible.  I am quite miserable that even someone like Billie Joe Armstrong will go for and continue being with someone never fails to have an attitude.  She needs to go home, get some perspective, get  a reality check, get a pair of sissors and cut those nasty deadlocks off and take a shower.  Then say sorry to everyone she has been nasty to and to Billie for acting like a diva. I do not like her, not because I am a 14 year old it is because she comes accross as arrogant and horrible and mean."
,"All of you people agreeing that Addie and Billie should get a divorce, you clearly aren't Green Day fans. Fans worship the band and want what's best for them AND their members.
Let's start with my 1st arguement.
Firstly, someone here stated that ""He admitted in an interview he was not happy being the stay at home suburban dad. So let him go back to being that or what ever the hell he was before he made it. I think he was a bus boy or something. Let 's see if she stays with him when he's a bus boy again.""
This is completely wrong. Infact, Billie Joe met Addrienne WHILST touring BEFORE Green Day were even famous! Billie Joe had been in the band since he and Mike were 15. They started the band. Billie Joe said in MTV: Behind The Music, Green Day special, that Addie had nothing to do with the band. She wasn't a roadie or anything. He just met her on the street, and he happened to be touring with the band in that area, WHEN HE WAS 19 YEARS OF AGE! Billie is now 39 years old as of early 2011.
My second arguement.
I've read MULTIPLE comments on here saying that Addie is wrecking Green Day and Billie Joe's career.
Once again, read my first arguement. Billie Joe was so in love with Addie, he had this infatuation he could not break. He got the band to tour again in the area where Addie lived, so he could see her again. This tour would have, no doubt, mad the band get A LOT more fans and followers. This was all before the band was even popular. Billie Joe, Mike and Tre all lived in an apartment together, with Tre's dad driving them in a tour bus. That is the time that Adie and Billie fell in love. PROVING that she didn't marry him for his money or fame.
My final arguement.
Someone commented ""She is incredibly nasty to the female fans of Green Day and ultimately will destroy Billie's brilliant career. He is stupid (and apparently blind) for staying with her.""
This is one of the most disgusting biased opinions I've ever heard. If I knew who that person was I would certainly strike that person down for being so rude and cruel to someone who they've probobly never even met to get a decent opinion of her!
Billie Joe is his own person. He can do whatever he wants. He can marry who ever he wants. I'm not joking, at least half of Green Day's songs are about his wife. The song ""Last Of The American Girls"" a perfect example. It is about Addie, and is also a popular radio song. Many other GREAT songs by green Day have been inspired and written about Addie. Therefore, she is NOT ruining Green Day. She was Billie's Girlfriend before they were even popular, and she always has been. No doubt if Addie WASN'T Billie's wife, Green Day wouldn't even be HALF as popular as they are now. All of you biased commenters probobly wouldn't even know who green Day were if it wasn't for Adie.
Just because Billie Joe is an extremely attractive man, and that plenty of females would like to date him, doesn't mean he isn't allowed to have a wife. I have talked to many many many female fans of green Day, who think that Adie is the most beautiful women in the world. Some of these people have even met and had the chance to have a normal conversation with her. She is a beautful women who inspires Green Day so much. Sure, Billie has stated that they fight, but all couple have their fights! It's what keeps them so strong and close.
I can tell you that Billie Joe has talked about how he loves Addie so much, much more frequently than when he talks about them fighting.
Billie Joe and Addie ARE NOT Getting a divorce. They love eachtoher VERY much. Just because they are a family, does not mean she is a horrible person who only wants Billie for his kids and money.
I rest my case.
Rage n Love.
~Kahlia~"
,"I have no idea on whether they are getting divorced or not.  But I will say that this woman is totally turning me off of Green Day.  The more I hear about her the less and less of a Green Day fan I become.  I don't know where you people are getting your information from, especially the person who says they know they are building a house closer to the kids school.  You just sound like a stalker.  I don't see that Billie put out this statement in any interview.  So how do you know it????  I will agree with the statements that she is a fat, disgusting, ugly slob and Billie SHOULD finally divorce her already.  This woman has done nothing of merit in her own life and she is not part of Green Day.  Billie should lead by example. Enough about his big fat wife and more about the music.  If he was smart he would see how she is hurting his career and how she is turning off all of his fans."
,"Hey... I`m German, my english is not so good.... But I want to tell some words: I think you`re all unfair! Adrienne is his wife of 15 years, it`s alone Billies decision, if he get with her or not. I think she`s a beautiful mother and a beautiful wife. Nobody know him or her... Nobody here knows, as they live and on the face of their family-life. It´s only because everyone thinks, Billie is hot and for this reason everyone find his wife shitty... Maybe Billie is private an asshole and all he does is only show and commercial, who knows?! Also how can you know, that Adrienne is shitty? My opinion is, that the female fans are jealous of her and for this reason they set everyone on her. Let they live their life and you live your life and good is... And for the last: Who cares, if they get a divorce or not?"
,"They fell in love 15 years ago. They are still together. Billie doesnt give a s*** if you think she's ugly, unattractive or untalented. He loves her for who she is, and he definitely doesn't care about losing fans because of her. It's not like someone who actually like the music would stop doing that because of Adrienne. That is pathetic if anything. You have absolutely nothing to do with his life!

Adrienne loves her man, support him when his on tour and taking care of the kids.
Just like her, Billie want to support his wife.

Grow up and wait til you get married and have kids. Then you might understand.

And if someone else wants to tell us why they should get a divorce, please give me one good reason, not one about her looks (because that's not a reason), and you will probably find out that there is none. Well, you might finally get that you are jealous. But that we already knew."
,I don't think they are getting divorced but I think he SHOULD divorce her.  She is a nasty slob and hands down the ugliest woman alive.   I also think it's funny that he thinks he could have any kind of a  solo career or solo side project when she is doing her best to turn off every female fan he has (the majority of Billie's fans are female).  I think she will not be happy until she totally destroys his career.   The only really smart comments here is that the female fans should not help support this ugly monster's elaborate lifestyle.  And as much as I love Billie if he allows her to behave like that then he really does not deserve the fans he has.  Maybe when he realizes he is losing fans he will finally do something about her.
,"I don't think that they are divorcing but I definitely think he should divorce her.  He's totally outgrown her and she is totally ruining his otherwise brilliant career.  I feel so bad that she has turned off so many of Billie's fans.  A big thump on the head to her.  She is obviously not too bright because she should know that you don't bite off the hand that feeds you.  It's the fans spending money on their concerts, merchandise, etc. That has afforded this pig her fancy lifestyle.  I don't blame the fans who want to turn their backs on Billie because of her.  But it's so sad that Billie has to be hurt because of her.  Really you girls should just laugh at her.  She is so pathetic.  She's fat, she's ugly, and just the pathetic excuse for a woman.  Her husband has admitted in interviews being attracted to men while married to her.  Sounds more to me like Adrienne is more worried and jealous at the hundreds of good looking fans that flock to see Billie.  If she is nasty to you laugh in her face or throw a donut her way. That will certainly get rid of her.  But try not to make Billie suffer because of her actions.  He's a really great guy and Green Day is a great group.  They shouldn't suffer because of this fat hog."
,I think just about everyone thinks he should divorce her but I haven't heard that they are separating - although people have said for years that they fight like cats and dogs.  I have always wonder why he just doesn't cut her loose already.  She is absolutely hideous.  I vomit in my mouth everytime I see a picture of her.  But you never really know what goes on in a marriage.  Just the other day Out magazine did an interview with Billie Joe.  He admits to being bisexual and admits to having feelings for men while married to her.  It's there in print you can see it.   I have to think that besides being hideously ugly she is the most pathetic person alive.  What kind of woman stays with a man who admits to having feelings for men while he is married to you.  Only a sad woman like her.  You girls shouldn't be upset by her - you should laugh in her face.
,"I'd say the majority of you would not have gone near BJ unless he was famous. Adrienne & BJ fell in love when he was a nobody & they have been together through the rough & the smooth.  I don't blame her wanting to keep the skanks & groupies at bay...btw, there are kids involved here & please be aware that they could come across these websites and you should all grow up and get over your poisonous jealousy.  As much as you would love to believe they may be separating, I hope they don't and especially not for reasons of keeping the fans happy.  Do you honestly think he'd be blackmailed into dumping his Mrs to keep the fans happy...pure delusional B.S.  I too also think BJ is very hot but have the respect for him as a husband and a father.  When I met him in October he turned out to be one of the most charming, polite men I have met who is famous - guys grow up and wish him and his family well instead of your vicious gossip mongering. If you don't want to buy Green Day's records then that is your choice but there a thousands of us out there who will."
,"Everyone who is slamming Adrienne because of her looks should be ashamed of themselves. It is none of your business how she looks. Billie loves her and for everyone to be going on about how much of a fat slob she is is absolutely dissapointing. You guys call yourselves green day fans, I wouldn't class you guys as fans. And as for Billie and Adrienne's arguments that is perfectly normal, if you have been with someone for basically half your life then you are going to have disagreements. And I wouldn't say that she is jealous of Billie's fans, I would say that you guys are jealous of her because she was able to find the man of her dreams and have a really happy and fulfilling life. And if all your interested in is Billie's relationship then stop being a fan of Green day's because there is more than one person in the band and they are just as important as Billie."
,"This discussion is hilarious.  Adrienne is an extremely accomplished, educated, and beautiful person who captured Billie's heart and soul years ago.  Why is there an impression that the house was put on the market ""all of a sudden?""  How would you know that? How do you know they didn't spend time redecorating/refurnishing in order to sell it?  Have you seen the interior pictures?   She and Billie and the boys spent time at their house in Mnneapolis over Christmas and they seemed to be perfectly fine. I live there and saw them out to eat one night and at a show in Dinkytown.   I've been a Green day fan for many years and I've had the good fortune to meet them both, separately and together, several times.  For the people who are saying they can't be Green Day fans anymore because of Adrienne, that's probably for the best.  If you don't respect and appreciate his relationship with her and what she means to him, you'll never truly undersatnd Billie, or Green Day for that matter.  Hate to sound cheesy, but good riddance to you and I hope to never see you at a show."
,"No divorce guys. They are building new house closer to the boys school. If you think Adi is fat then you must have a very strange view of people......do you live in America?  As most people there are 5 times Adi's size.

Stop your nonsense and enjoy the music!!!!"
,"My husband works in the Hotel Green Day stayed at in Sydney, Australia, Billie was there with Adrienne. He says they are both really nice people and certainly looked very much in love. All the kids were with them too (Billie and Adrienne's and Mike's). This was at the beginning of December so obviously they are still together."
,"No, I don't think that they are getting a divorce but I do agree that Billie should have dumped her years ago.  I can't believe that he is even married to that creature.  She is the ugliest woman I have ever seen in all of my life.  She makes you want to vomit just looking at her.  I have heard she is incredibly nasty to Billie's female fans.  But I don't think you should let her upset you.  I would just laugh in her face because she is completely pathetic and laughable."
,"No, no divorce.  Billie seems to be married to Fat Mama Cass and I don't see that he is leaving her anytime soon.  Why would he she is the only woman stupid enough to stay with him while he admits that he is attracted to men.  He just did an interview with Out Magazine where he admits it.  She stay with him because she is so pathetic, fat and ugly, really no one else would want her.  If SHE had any self respect she would leave him but just look at what a fat, ugly slob she is.  Does this look like a woman who has any respect for herself????"
,"Here`s the german girl again... At the guest above these comment: THANX! That`s my opinion, too. You bring it to the point. I can`t explain my comment so good, because my english is terrible ;-) All these people here are unfair. And as I say: Who cares, if they get a divorce or not?????? But the discussion is amazing :-))"
,"They met when they were young, he has written many love songs, he loves her, the way she is. People should stop carrying about looks, and being so ....just stupid, ....Are looks really all that matter ??? NO, he loves her and only her. And I think she is very brave and (it's something I couldn't do)  she lets him kiss guys because it's a tradition!
....Addie  loves Billie joe! They married as soon as they were able to.
They married in like 5 minutes. IN their backyard.
They were young, and in love, neither knew that Green day would be such a success, addie wouldn't have cared if he wouldn't have been a celebrity, they just loved each other...

DO YOU all not believe in unconditional love????
If you don't...you are an IDIOT

80 loves BJ and BJ loves 80"
,"I am a woman of good taste and I LOVE Billie joe as much as the other person but,I think you should just leave his personal life alown.I mean where aloud to have bf and gf but why not him?I think he should be-able to have a wife without ANY trouble.SO LEAVE HIM alown!!!"
,This is seriously horrible. I've been a green day fan forever. I love their music and think that they are purely amazing. Those of you who are putting Adrienne down in the dirt should be ashamed of yourselves. Billie joe and her have been together for so long. Its pretty clear that they love each other. I think she is a gorgeous woman and those of you calling her fat.. You have to remember that she did give birth twice and considering I think she still looks amazing. You people who call yourselves fans and cut down green days loved ones disgust me! You definitely don't deserve to be a true green day fan. Adie has been inspiration to billie joe. I don't see him writing songs about you so get over yourselves.
,"They are still together but obviously most fans thing he would be better off without her.  They seem to argue a lot though.  Most fans resent her to some degree while others seem to suck up to her because they think that they should to keep Billie Joe happy so that he is not angry.  When I hear she is allegedly horrible to the fans it really makes me livid.  If it is true, she should know better.  Also if it is true, she does not deserve him at all if that is the case.   Oviously he is seeing something entirely different from what most of the fans are seeing.  Why can't we see this side more?? She seems to me totally taking him for granted and most fans just thing that he should dump her."
,"Oh come on I am 14 years old...And WTH is your talking about...Just listen to their music...I am a big fans of green day,, Wake up dude.....""Dreams are dreams"" ...I'm crazy by Billie Joe Armstrong....and I think Addie is beautiful....Getting divorce or not,, is it just their own problem...nothing to do with us! Fat, Ugly, Disgusting slob...Pay attention all of you,,, stand up in the mirror  and you'll see ""HOW BAD YOU ARE"" beauty is not only from face, body, from
heart either.  ""GREAT ANSWER"" or ""NOT HELP"" you are just vote if its answer said that ""Billie should leave her"" then you vote NOT HELP answer. You are not asking but hopeless. I don't think that they are getting divorce,, I think you'll vote NOT HELP, FYI, IDTS."
,"I think everyone should just leave Adi alone :( Billie Joe loves her so much. There such a nice couple, and they've been together for like, what, 20 years now? I hope the never get a divorce, there such a cute family. 
Stop being so jealous of her and instead, be happy for her! I think she's the luckiest person in the world :) 
It makes me sick to read all the bad things that people say about her. I can't imagine how much it would hurt reading something like that if it were me. And everyone knows how crazy punk rock concerts can get xD Adi is just making sure that Billie Joe doesn't have to dive onto anybody or kick his fans out like he has done a couple of times before xD it would put me in a bad mood if someone was being a dick at my concert and i had to kick them out myself. 
So leave her alone! :("
,"Church on sunday was writtten by Billie Joe Armstrong to convince Adrienne not to leave him, and she didn't. They're still together"
,"No, he is not"
,"Billie Joe Armstrong is not divorcing his wife because the King of Punk likes his woman old, fat and ugly.  He also likes his men young, thin and pretty."
,"Okay first of all, regardless of whether they are getting divorced or not, what the Hell gives any of you the right to be so bitchy about Adrienne? Fair enough if any of you actually know her and have decided you don't like her, but honestly, how many of you is that? In fact how many of you know Billie personally and can vouch for him being everything he projects himself to be in the media, behind closed doors? Who the Hell knows the full story, and unless you are their family (very unlikely!) what business is it of yours whether they fight all the time, or they're getting divorced or not?! Secondly, as none of you have anything to do with their marriage and most if not all of you do not know them personally, what right do you have to say whether Billie should divorce Adrienne and that she's not good enough for him? They've been married for about 15 years now so I think if anyone can decide whether Adrienne is good enough for him, it's Billie! Third, Green Day are a band, they produce music - I always thought that by saying you liked a certain band you are stating that you are a fan of their music, and I honestly don't see how the way a person behaves towards their fans can change their views on their music, which is essentially what being a fan of a band is all about, isn't it? It amazes me that people can be so judgemental about situations that don't concern them."
,"The fact that they have had so many marital problems is no big secret.  Billie should have dumped her years ago.  She is incredibly nasty to Green Day's female fans.  But it is interesting to know that he is building this nasty cow another house.  I will know not to purchase any more Green Day merchandise or concert tickets.  It really bothers me that she is such a nasty, fat slob and it's us stupid fans who are putting her up in another fancy house with all of the money we spend on Green Day stuff.  Billie can just do concerts for his ugly wife in their new home.  ""Jump Heffer, Jump, Jump, Jump""  ""Get those hands in the air, Fatso"" ,  ""Say Hey ----oooooooo, ugly!!!!"" If he is stupid enough to keep her, then he should just disappear with her.  It is such a shame because he could have an absolute AMAZING career and really become one of the legends of rock.  This fat slob is totally ruining his brilliant career."
,She is a fat ugly pig who bitches and whines about the difficulties of being married to him.  She looks like Medusa. He SHOULD DIVORCE HER.  I tend to think that there may be some truth to the rumors as he all of a sudden put his house up for sale in September.  It seems extremely odd that someone would put their house up for sale while he is in the middle of a world tour.  One would think that he would wait until the tour was over and was home before he did that.  The fact that his house was all of a sudden put up for sale does make it seem that their is truth to their separation or maybe a divorce is in the works.
,"This whole fighting wouldn't be happening if them darn kids get off my lawn. :v

Their relationship isn't any of your business. If they were getting a divorce, they would have already divorced now. If Billie says he loves her, then let it be. You don't run their lives.

Okay now let's all stop fighting and love now."
,"I honestly don't know. I think people are jealous of her because they are hoping he will leave her and marry them. Btw: GET OVER IT! He loves her to death and that doesn't give you any reason to say mean things about her. Even if she is being nasty to female fans that doesn't mean that you should boycott green day completely. They're a great band and just because one of them might possibly have a snobbish wife doesn't mean that you can't like them. Billie joe also isn't using her as a cover up for being gay. He's bi and he chose to marry a woman in the end. And if you think adrienne is fat, ugly, or medusa like, then I have no idea what's wrong with you."
,"The problem is, The people of the United States of America ain't got enough time to mind their own business cause they got their nose's shoved up everybody else's asses wanting to know their business. ""Pay mind to your own business and you won't have time to mind other people's business!"" And one more thing, ""GET THESE LIFE STEALING MEXICANS OUTTA MY COUNTRY!"", and ""BRING THE TROOP'S HOME!"""
,"Billie was with his wife of nearly 16 years at the Grammys looking very happy and in love. Get over yourselves. He's not going to leave her. He loves her and she has stuck with him through good times and bad. Their marriage isn't perfect, but whose is? They love each other and are committed to each other and that's all that matters. Couples fight. It's a fact. That doesn't mean they don't love each other, or want to get a divorce."
," would you people just get over the fact that billie loves adrienne and adrienne loves billie! I think shes a beautiful woman stop calling her a beast ! If billie broke up with adrienne he would have already done it by now!And if Adrienne broke up with Billie he wouldnt be able to write all of the songs we love so stop being a green eyed monster !! Billie loves Adrienne and we love GREEN DAY!!! Ang yes he admitted when his first son Joey Marciano Armstrong was born that he is bisexual theres nothing wrong with that ! It obiously dosnt bother Adrienne and that a good thing not to be jealous . So you people that hate her get over it Adrienne loves him,and he loves Adrienne !"
,"I'm not sure....but I think he should she is a fat, disgusting slob.  I throw up in my mouth everytime I see a picture of her."
Should I go to church in the evening? I need to get closer to God and it would make me feel better but I'm not sure so should I?,"Few churches ever lock their doors, and you’ll likely find services most anytime, especially at this time of year."
,If it'll make you feel better why not? You can always leave if it's not what you thought it would be.
,You do what makes you happy. No one else can answer for you.
,I agree with all responses.
,Go to church
,Going to church not going to get you closer god? Church is more of a social gathering in the name of god showing off each one's acquisitions? Just live right is suffice to get closer to god.
can i turn into a mermaid with salt and water?,Absolutely 
,"no. Please don’t try, you might get hurt and the pain wouldn’t be worth it since you still wouldn't be a mermaid."

,Yes with mermaid costume and not with brine.

,"Yes, I believe in God. I believe the Bible and pray every single day that I won't stop. That I won't b distracted or listen to others who try to tell me He is not real.
I know in my heart. Somethings I have prayed for, have happened. One can argue they ate all coincidence but that's ALOT of coincidence.
I just know in,my heart. I don't have to weigh the pros and cons"
,"Nope.  No belief in the Christian God, Odin, Zeus, Jupiter, the FSM or any others. "
,Someone or something has created this mess on earth
,"I no longer believe in any God/Gods.
I'll go one better and give you a ""If No Why?"" -  I don't believe in God because there simply lacks ANY evidence to the contrary.  Now having said that IF sufficient evidence were produced to prove there was a God . . . I would believe. . . Now, how many of the ""Yay Sayers"" can say they would do the same with regards to disbelief?
It should be noted - I may not bow down or worship the God (Based upon which God/Gods, out of the MANY, proved their existence) because they would have done literally nothing to warrant such an act. "
,"Yes, It took me to hit rock bottom before seeking him and I found him.Who ever seeks me will find me when they seek me with all of their heart."
,yes cause he did for me.
,"I believe that reality is the need to expose magic, and therefore magic - or God - is the non-need to expose reality
Non-need is freedom. Freedom to expose reality is inability to expose reality
Inability to expose reality is inability to expose inability
God is weakness exposing another weakness"
,"Yes I do. Why- because he is the sustainer of life, and every breath."
,"Q ""Do you believe in God? If yes, then why?""
1. There are only two positions here. One that allows for the possibility of God and the other one that rules out any possibility of God. There is no position in between.
2. It's an undeniable fact that there has never been any evidence to back up the position that rules out any possibility of God.. There is no evidence now, for that position, and we already know [it's a foregone and guaranteed conclusion] that there will never be any evidence for that position. It is therefore a dead loss, and it makes no sense, to take that position.
3. I agree with all those who say that there has never been any direct evidence for God. I also agree that even now [at the time of posting this] there is no direct evidence for God. However, NOBODY can guarantee that there will NEVER be any direct evidence for God. It therefore makes far more sense to take up the position that allows for the possibility of God than to take up the position that rules out any possibility of God."
,"Yes. I experienced God when arguing as an atheist with a Christian over the existence of where God is in time. Before this I was an atheist/buddhist for 8 years. God can only enter the temple when you question all your ideas about everything you think you know, and so making space. The ego stands watch with false ideas so God cannot enter in.
The I observes the Me. The Ego is Me with which I identify.

Just as the serpent or shining one beguiled Eve with the knowledge of good And Evil, duality, the self we were separated.
The hermetic or gnostic has similar story about Sophia (wisdom) trying to create without her consort understanding - Christ.

The things we are taught in church is planetary worship. However the occult or hidden meaning is kept from us and it's made the church rich. However, secular also includes the same story in there rituals and media.
The chequered floor represents duality. We came from one and now are two.
Kabbalah is seen in many things alot of celebs are in to it. You hear about the sephirah but not the Quiloth - evil tree.
Lilith rules over Malcoth (material world)in Quiloth.
Lilith is equated with the black moon
You'll see alot of singers have ritually turned bad in pop Beyonce was ritually blown up in her car in Crazy Right Now and emerged this sexy dark women, the same happened to Rihanna who often equates herself eith Inanna aka Lilith
 She sings umbrella, this word comes from latin Umbra which means shadow or ghost.  She sings it is raining Jay z is the Rain man, who is samael or satan reigning money, riches etc, 
and she invites you to stand under her shadow.

They want you to appeal to your shadow self your dual character, the subconscious where Lilith lays waiting she is equated with the Moon, the lesser light. She is the temptess the opposite of eve, she is The Queen of the Night.

Many songs are about Lilith and the shadow self, also called Layla, Lilly, Lucy.  Many of these songs relate to the midnight hour, magic or the witching hour.
The goat is equated with the beastly nature of man, especially sex. If man does not believe in God then he does not believe in a spiritual self he believes is purely material, ""a material girl iving in a material world."" He will not seek another way out and will either decine losing the battle with his beastly self or he'll die a death for the spirit is not in him. This is why John talks about being born of spirit. All men are born of flesh they must be born of God. Even some Jews believe in reincarnation and Jacobs ladder.
 There battle between  of good v evil and you choose. Jesus the son tries to shine light, promote altruism,  love thy neighbour, do not store up riches, this is because the measure of a man is weighed in the heart. 
The ancients knew about the zodiac the celestial realm, but they also believed the sun was a material object, but Gods light wasn't. We battle with our own darkness and each others everyday and some want us giving into perversion, lust and violence which is why television is packed with it, this entertains your shadow, your subconscious cannot tell the difference from a story and reality."
Is it offensive to make fun of racism?,yes its not nice to do that. Like my mom says we all bleed the same color.

Is there a reverse cellphone lookup service?,"Looking for a reverse cellphone lookup? Maybe a service where the caller's name is provided?
Well there are a bunch of services that are available online: Some are free, some aren't.
Reverse cellphone lookups
Like most things in this life, if you pay money you generally get a better deal than the freebie version.
Having said that, sites like Phonelookup.com (I know, how did they think up the name?) are useful services that won't cost you a dime.
The downside is that they simply don't have access to all the phone data in the world, so there's always a chance you'll draw a blank...
Another option would be to check out the leaky bank of private data that is Facebook. You'll be surprised just how many people publish their phone details on Facebook, especially now that more and more people sign up and use the service from their mobile devices.
Finally, I'd also throw in a warning. There are plenty of ""scammy"" sites out there just looking to cash in on your need for info.
Be very careful who you hand out credit card details to."
